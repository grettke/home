* Introduction

Choosing my font for ALEC has been a journey. Gosh, that is a very serious word.
It has been a /learning experience/. I never questioned font choice before. Font
design is an art form. Font choice is an art form, too. I learned something.

The purpose of this document is to capture parts of that journey that I valued.

* Audience

- Computer
  - Users
  - Programmers
  - User experience designers (UXD)
- Non-Computer
  - Readers

Every computer-user has a different strategy for choosing the best font for long
periods working at the computer. They all involve many metrics, strategies, and
rubrics. Based on that, they are probably all wrong. Well not really, they are
right based upon experience, and experience is really all that matters.

Non-computer users are important too. I am one. I love being able to sent a
printed letter for /important things/. I love being able to read when /not/ at a
computer. This journey helped reveal that for me.

I was curious about whether my experience had any basis in reality, and I really
wanted to dig into what is the "right way" to choose a font for any particular
user or situation. The following are notes and ultimately a decision on what is
the best for me. Hopefully the notes alone are revealing and help you reach your
own conclusion, too. At the very least you ought to be educated, informed, and
probably surprised, too, about some of the factors involved in font selection.

* Resources

I started researching fonts using Internet search engines. I found a bunch of
resources. I read all of them and took notes. This heading captures addresses to
those resources and notes about them.

Serifs are tips for the reader's eyes for flow.

San-serifs are better for low-res.

Simultaneously states that is no difference between serif and san-serif.

Rec: Helvetica/Arial

Comment recommendations:

Designed for digital, Hermann Zapf's Optima, or as a backup Verdana

Designed for digital, Open Sans

Both, Calibri

San-serifs are easier on the eyes as you get older, citing retinal tears
specifically

** [[http://www.webpagecontent.com/arc_archive/182/5/][Time to change your fonts]]

Designed for screen: Verdana, Trebuchet MS, and (the serif) Georgia.

Easy to read, available on virtually all machines.

Let go of times new roman, Arial, and Helvetica.

Traditionally a serif font was used for the main body of a document, and
sans-serif for headings. Today, those principles are often reversed.

** [[http://www.awaionline.com/2011/10/the-best-fonts-to-use-in-print-online-and-email/][The Best Fonts to Use in Print, Online, and Email]]

Popular serif fonts are Times New Roman, Palatino, Georgia, Courier,
Bookman and Garamond.

Some popular San Serif fonts are Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, Century
Gothic and Verdana.

It's been said that serif fonts are for "readability," while sans-serif
fonts are for "legibility."

Best fonts for online: go with sans-serif.

2002 study by the Software Usability and Research Laboratory:
- The most legible fonts were Arial, Courier, and Verdana.
- At 10-point size, participants preferred Verdana. Times New Roman was
  the least preferred.
- At 12-point size, Arial was preferred and Times New Roman was the
  least preferred.
- The preferred font overall was Verdana, and Times New Roman was the
  least preferred.

For easiest online reading, use Arial 12-point size and larger. If
you're going smaller than 12 points, Verdana at 10 points is your best
choice. If you're after a formal look, use the font "Georgia." And for
older readers, use at least a 14-point font.

Dr. Ralph F. Wilson, an e-commerce consultant, did a series of tests in
2001. He also came to the conclusion that the sans-serif fonts are more
suited to the computer screen.Some of the highlights of the test results
were that at 12 points, respondents showed a preference for Arial over
Verdana -- 53% to 43% (with 4% not being able to distinguish between the
two).Two-thirds of respondents found that Verdana at 12 points was too
large for body text, but Verdana at 10 points was voted more readable
than Arial at 10 points by a 2 to 1 margin.In conclusion, for the best
font readability, use Arial 12 point or Verdana at 10 points and 9
points for body text. For headlines, he suggests using larger bold
Verdana.

Comments: Good.

Post: Advice to use san-serif is outdated and inappropriate for today's
high resolution screens. San-serif or not is irrelevant; instead the
measure of success is to use a large font that was specifically designed
for on-screen usage. For inspiration, look at the free fonts listed at
the Google Web Fonts directory, especially Vollkorn or the Droid Serif
font which was particularly developed with small font size in mind.

GCR: That post is confusing because he later explains that we are not
there yet, but rather getting close.

Post: Sans-serif are best for on-screen.

Legibility refers to being able to read a text in bad conditions.
“Legibility is concerned with the very fine details of typeface design,
and in an operational context this usually means the ability to
recognize individual letters or words. Readability however concerns the
optimum arrangement and layout of whole bodies of text”

Studies that contrast serif vs. non-serif fonts seem to be
controversial.

There are some ground rules one can find, like:
- Don't make long lines nor too long paragraphs
- Use wide fonts such as Palatino or Verdana for small fonts
- Use spaces between lines, e.g. about 1.2 at least. E.g. in Word 2007,
  1.15 is the default I believe. to be controversial.

Sans serif: Verdana (a humanist font) or Arial

Serif: Georgia

Some references for studies and research done on fonts.

“two roles for type: a functional role (relating to legibility) and an
aesthetic/semantic role, which impacts the "apparent 'fitness' or
'suitability' for different functions, and which imbue it with the power
to evoke in the perceiver certain emotional and cognitive response" (p.
38)””

In her study: Calibri came out as a winner against Courier New and Curlz.

GCR: Very exciting and interesting with good links

Serif: Georgia. It was designed especially for screen. Other options are
listed.

Sans-Serif: Tahoma. Geneva, Tahoma, and Verdana were designed especially
for the screen. Tahoma in particular is cited for legibility. Another
pick: Lucida Sans Unicode: Cited as remarkably legible for some reason.

Monospaced: Monaco/Lucida Console.

GCR: Great article.

** [[http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/52/uk_font.htm][A Comparison of Two Computer Fonts: Serif versus Ornate Sans Serif]]

Another study, unsure what to conclude from it.

** [[http://usabilitynews.org/a-comparison-of-popular-online-fonts-which-size-and-type-is-best/][A Comparison of Popular Online Fonts: Which Size and Type is Best?]]

Excellent details.

Tahoma and Verdana, sans-serifs, were designed specifically for viewing
on computer screens. J, I, and 1 were made distinguishable. Tahoma is
wider than Verdana.

Great article but leaves so many questions and stuff unanswered and
explored.

** [[http://usabilitynews.org/a-comparison-of-popular-online-fonts-which-is-best-and-when/][A Comparison of Popular Online Fonts: Which is Best and When?]]

Big fonts generally don't matter and are easy to read.

Tahoma is well-read.

Verdana and Georgia have good legibility.

Whole other range of evaluations: personality, elegant, youthful and
fun, business-like,

Most legible: Courier, Comic, Verdana, Georgia, and Times.

I only read this article months after reading the bulk of references in this
section. It took time it to sink and for me to accept it. It is so easy to
produce a letter in LaTeX, and just send a PDF. It should really be printed,
though. So, what is the right medium and what is the right font? For formal
things, things worth writng, I say paper.

I read it again and noted the following:

You must know your target market's viewing medium. If it is computer-users, then
"its better to use a modern font that has been drawn with the screen in mind.".
The fact "is that our display technology isn’t up to par with paper.".

That makes it simple: I don't know the target audience. I loved the printed
word. I love something real that engages touch and smell in addition to sight.
By that measure, I am my own target audience, and it is simple: printed
literature will be done using Garamond.

** [[http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/03/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/][SERIF VS. SANS: THE FINAL BATTLE]]

I was curious again so I searched for articles to share with people who haven't
done any research on the topic. I found this one. It is good. It "expertly
explains why serif is better for print and sans serif is best suited for web".
"For web" really means "For a low-resolution monitor". What is the right thing?
In modern times, obviously the screen. That makes the most sense. Perhaps there
is a really easy way to switch printed fonts? My use case is quite minimal: I
love easily read text for important letters. They are few and far between.
However, they are important. Is a resume that important? Not really.
Correspondence is, though. That is the thing that I value. Printed
correspondence. Perhaps that is just fine? If it is kind sorta not super perfect
on-screen, perhaps that is OK, because the printed, viewable, touchable, and
smellable form will always be the most delightful.

* Questions & Answers

The questions are simple.

Reality is high-resolution. Computer screens are low-resolution. Font designers
create fonts to make it easy for you to read given the medium. Choose the right
font for the medium. Serif is for printed text. San-serif is for computer
screens.

You must make a decision about your medium. To do that, you you must be able to
define your intent and your goal.

Most of my trade work is performed on a computer screen. This is at least six
hour a day. I value this tool, the computer and its screen. This is an important
medium.

My content publishing is performed on a computer screen. I consume blogs using a
computer screen. I value that. I publish a personal notebook style blog. I value
that.

Most of my important personal interaction is performed on a printed piece of
paper. This is called correspondence. Org and TeX produce fine documents that
are easy to read. Important things deserve to be printed and shared without a
power cord. This is an important medium.

I want a good font for all 3 mediums.

** Retrospective

This definition of 3 mediums became clear only later. It took time for me to
understand them, the difference, and their value. Font decisions become to clear
once you understand your audience and your medium. That is when the fun starts
skyrocketing. There is so much creativity in entire process. It is really all
quite delightful.

* Goals & Medium

** Literate Programming on a Computer

- Research
  - Emacs is the primary environment
  - [[Resources]] provided plenty
  - [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_unicode_fonts.html][Best Unicode Fonts for Programming]]
    - Nice article
    - Nice discussion
    - Great link to the [[http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragmatapro.htm][PragmataPro]] font
      - As you read about the font, you can feel the passion of the designer
      - Excellent examples, clearly a lot of love went into this!
  - [[http://www.slant.co/topics/67/viewpoints/4/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts~dejavu-sans-mono][What are the best programming fonts?]]
    - Tons of coding related fonts. Why not for reading?!
    - Source Code Pro is highest ranked, then Consolas, and Monaco
    - I really care about reading, too, literate programming is a big big deal
    - I've since changed this heading to make it obvious what the use case
      really is
  - [[http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30040/Font-Survey-42-of-the-Best-Monospaced-Programming][Font Survey: 42 of the Best Monospaced Programming Fonts]]
    - The options, although only 42, are insanely overwhelming.

- Thoughts
  - Current state of technology along with aging-eyes means that sans-serif is the
    best option
  - Emacs suggest mono-spaced fonts for coding
  - Experienced teaches me that Unicode support is mandatory
  - Prefer fonts that focus on legibility over emotional evocation
  - Like: Verdana, Calibri, Tahoma, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans Console
  - DejaVu Sans Mono: best Unicode support
    - Based on Andale Mono, a monospaced san-serif designed for coding

- Conclusions
  - There isn't a ton of digestible info available on Unicode support for
    the fonts that I listed.
  - I am recalling now that my original selection of DejaVu Sans Mono was
    specifically for its excellent Unicode support; specifically that it
    had better support than Lucida Console which is monospaced but lacked
    characters and looks at least as nice.
  - Seems like it is just haphazard and quasi-scientific how people are
    choosing fonts; and maybe even designing them.
  - Found evidence that Lucida is just fine for display; and thus
    DejaVu Sans Mono is fine for display.
  - PragmataPro is intriguing
  - I want a great font for Literate Programming
    - Good for code
    - Good for the written word
    - On a computer screen, both are first class citizens
    - Must be perfect for both

- Decisions
  - DejaVu Sans Mono is the best available font

** Publishing on a Computer

- Research
  - WordPress is the primary environment
  - [[Resources]] provided plenty

- Thoughts
  - Nothing to add: Georgia is a serif designed for the web

- Conclusions
  - MS Word introduced me to Georgia and I loved it >7 years ago
  - Georgia has served me well on W&W for 7 years
    - That is for content
    - Headings are Arial (san-serif)
  - Georgia readily available and I already love it for on-screen reading

- Decisions
  - Georgia is the best available font

** Correspondence on Printed Paper

- Research
  - TeX
    - Limiting study to first 3 pages or search results, or so

            - Two approaches: chose particular size
            - Egenolff-Berner Speciment mentioned!
            - Interesting to see oldstyle and lining figures
            - Titling capitals, too
            - Ligatures, fractions, superiors, inferiors, numerators,
              denominators
            - Superior letters
            - Accented glyphs
            - Ornaments
        - Referenced [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/fontname/adobe.map][font map]], assume that these are the Adobe Garamond!

        - Does this provide fonts or a wrapper/integrator for them?
        - Mentions both URW and Adobe Gramond Pro... what is this?
        - Contain directions for how to install the AdobeGaramondPro font!
          #+begin_quote
          The Math Design project offers free mathematical fonts that match
          with existing text fonts.
          To date, three free font families are available: Adobe Utopia, URW
          Garamond and Bitstream Charter. Three commercial fonts are also
          supported: Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe UtopiaStd and ITC Charter.
          Mathdesign covers the whole LATEX glyph set, including AMS symbols
          and some extra. Both roman and bold versions of these symbols can be
          used. Moreover you can choose between three greek fonts (two of them
          created by the Greek Font Society).
          #+end_quote
    - Adobe Garamond and mathedesign seem like the best choice
  - Garamond comes with macOS and XeTeX can use it.

        - Note about how the Adbobe is the best
        - At the time only Type 1 was available
      - [[http://gael-varoquaux.info/science/garamond-fonts-for-latex.html][A Post]]
        - "One remark on this example: you should never, ever, use the standards
          out-of-the-box T1 fonts with pdfLaTeX, they look ugly. Always include
          the “lmodern” or “pslatex” package, that uses much better postscript
          fonts."
        - Wonder if this is important for pdfTeX? Know that T1 is mentioned in the
          Org setup
          - Seems you can choose to [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/examples/article-class.html][not load it]] at all, see fontenc.
