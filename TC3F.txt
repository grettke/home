1 How to design a file conservator (HTDFC) or The Care and Conservation of Computer Files (TC3F)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════




1.1 Audience [1]
────────────────

  Who should be reading this?  Possibly…
  • Entire document: Software engineers who want to do the above [2]
    • If you are using this an excuse to learn Lisp, then know that it
      is really, really simple. Here is how it goes:
      • 3s to download Emacs
      • 3m to learn how to run code
      • 3h to learn the IDE
      • 3d to master the language
  • Decisions & Assembly: Existing Emacs users… daily usage and
    non-trivial customization An interest in using package/el-get/cask
    and org-mode literate programming are the only thing that would
    motivate anyone to read this really.

  This is an unfinished and experimental document. All successes with it
  may be attributed to all of the folks who provided these wonderful
  tools. All failures with it may be attributed to me.

  Why should they be reading this?
        The expectations of life depend upon diligence; the
        mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen
        his tools. [3]


1.2 Cogito ergo sum [4]
───────────────────────

  What was I thinking?
  creation: "the act of producing or causing to exist" [5]
  conservation: "prevention of injury, decay, waste, or loss" [6]
  computer files: "a file maintained in computer-readable form" [7]

  Pursuing these goals, in the manner of literate programming, also
  serves to better myself, as captured here:

        The expectations of life depend upon diligence; the
        mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen
        his tools. [8]


1.3 Means [9]
─────────────

  How do most people do it?
  File maintainer: a person and program responsible for TC3F
  COTS: edit, VI, Emacs, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio [10]
  Bespoke: custom software [11]


1.4 Madness [12]
────────────────

  What about their raison detre? [13]
  • Wonderful, wonderful stock tooling, 80%
  • Can tool-makers build it perfectly for us all? [14]
  • Either way:
        Thinking is required.


1.4.1 Goal
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  What is my measure of success?
   To provide a self-supportable environment in which the creation and
  	  conservation of computer files may occur with ease


1.5 Decision
────────────

        GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor [15]


1.6 Methodology [16]
────────────────────

  How will I customize it?

  Agile [17]
  • Product Backlog
  • Sprint Backlog
  • Review, Refine, and Reiterate
  • COTS libraries
  • Capture rationale and reasons along with things I did or didn't do
    and why
  • Includes links to everything

  Note: How you break up the initialization of a system like Emacs is
  mostly personal preference. Although org-mode (Babel) lets you tell a
  story, I was coming from a pretty structured configuration file to
  begin with. In the future, it might be interesting to look at this
  system from scratch in terms of doing literate
  programming. Fortunately, it provides that freedom out of the box.

1.9 Observations
────────────────

  • Went stunningly well
  • Stopped logging hours spent >200h
  • This configuration was developed organically quite differently from
    the original idea
  • Literate programming allowed an insanely flexible and freeing
    experience
  • This one massive experience for me made a powerful, positive,
    life-changing impression on me
  • My laziness and poor habits were made quite apparent going through
    the efforts to consider, realize, and support this system
  • Before beginning I had no value system about testing this kind of
    artifact
  • If this attribution, which is /only/ about Wolfram's MathWorld [33],
    the you may be interested in this style of programming and
    literature:
        Created, developed, and nurtured by Eric Weisstein at
        Wolfram Research


1.10 La trahison des images [34]
────────────────────────────────

  Where else has this acronym shown up?
  #cc33ff: bright purple color [35]
  Commander, U.S. Third Fleet: WWII navy [36]
