* Intent

This repository is used to publish my home directory org document. Virtually
all of my development occurs in a private repository. That is responsible for
ongoing, unstable changes. This repository is used to publish a known good and
/working/ version of the system.

It contains everything required to build it but for Emacs. It also contains
tangled and weaved artifacts that this system creates.
