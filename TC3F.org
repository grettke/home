** Audience [fn:6873a93e: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=audience&ia=luna]

Who should be reading this?
Possibly…
- Entire document: Software engineers who want to do the above [fn:15b6c04f: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer]
  - If you are using this an excuse to learn Lisp, then know that it is really,
    really simple. Here is how it goes:
    - 3s to download Emacs
    - 3m to learn how to run code
    - 3h to learn the IDE
    - 3d to master the language
- Decisions & Assembly: Existing Emacs users… daily usage and non-trivial customization
  An interest in using cask and org-mode literate programming are the only
  thing that would motivate anyone to read this really.

This is an unfinished and experimental document. All successes with it
may be attributed to all of the folks who provided these wonderful tools. All
failures with it may be attributed to me.

Why should they be reading this?

Note: How you break up the initialization of a system like Emacs is mostly
personal preference. Although org-mode (Babel) lets you tell a story, I was
coming from a pretty structured configuration file to begin with. In the future, it
might be interesting to look at this system from scratch in terms of doing
literate programming. Fortunately, it provides that freedom out of the box.

** Audience

- Myself
- The scope of my approach is neither totally scientific nor entirely thought
  out or even remotely near perfected. Despite that, the show must go on, and I
  want to keep a record of how and why I have pursued this goal.
- Most of the work performed within this document will be more-so a work of art,
  and philosophy, then of science, though science will definitely play a part.

** Keyboard usage strategies

*** Background

My personal keyboard layout has evolved quite slowly over the years. Beginning
as a begrudging Emacs user, I quickly learned some basic manners and abandoned
it. Problem was that I had no good reason to be using Emacs, and so, I failed.
Instead of a solution, I saw it as an obstacle. Lesson learned. When I wanted to
learn Scheme, Dr Racket worked out just fine. It wasn't until wanting to learn
OCaml that I became smitten with our dear Emacs.

My usage was pretty basic, customizing the bare minimum and sticking with
the defaults for everything. That approach is quite fine, for whatever point you
are at because you are more or less guaranteed excellent documentation on your
environment. This was my setup for years and it worked great. The more
comfortable you become, the more you change, and the more changes you make to
your configuration.

My configuration file grew, and grew, and grew. It had an ad-hock layout, and soon I
even started to forget why, or where, or how. With additional and hacks and the
usual, eventually I turned to literate programming with org-mode. That was and
is pure joy, and I've barely scratched the surface. This was a turning point for
me. At its simplest, I was then able to do everything that needed to be done in
Emacs, and it was then that I started caring a lot more about how my keyboard
was set up.

*** Version 001

The simplest and best place to start is to remap the control key to the center
left of the keyboard. On most keyboards, this is directly next to the "A" key.
This change alone served me quite well for years and years. It was after years
of usage that I got curious about "better ways" to do; and I suppose that is the
driving force behind thousands of Emacs packages. The change works well on
Windows, Linux, and OSX. Lately I've read a lot of material published by
bbatsov [fn:f92f3a46: https://github.com/bbatsov] and xahlee [fn:9cfe48f7: http://xahlee.org/] about their quests to perfect Emacs and
there is a lot of discussion about keyboard mappings that go so far as to talk
about how to avoid repetitive strain injury [fn:e81f19e8: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury] due to QWERTY [fn:48981e0d: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#QWERTY]. By "lately", I mean over
the course of a few years. That alone will get any computer user interested in
really thinking about their mappings and how to make things easier on their
wrists.

*** Version 002

One of the simplest changes discussed is simply to never twist and contort your
fingers into order to perform key chords that both the meta key itself and the
key with which you are chording. At first blush, his seemed silly to me, but
after trying it out for only a day or two, my wrists and hands simply felt
less worn out at the end of the day. That was intriguing having such immediate
results. All it took was swapping the enter key with one of the meta keys on the
bottom row. The lack of balance though quickly became kind of a nuisance.

Reading a range of links about the topic, I settled on a simple goal
of having meta key parity on both sides of the keyboard. That does take some
work. The experience resulting from the goal set forth, over the course of a few
months, morphed into the desire to grow the chording space into something much
more manageable, and began a new phase.

*** \alpha Version 003

In my minds eye, I see the key chording space in some broad, simple divisions,
roughly something like:
- Emacs :: built in bindings, most common, documentation exists for all
- Packages :: separately installed, generally play nice with Emacs
- Personal :: my own key-bindings that try to play nice and adhere to the spirit
  but generally struggle due to lack of remaining name-space control-land

All of the good key-bindings are used up. The "good ones" are easy to use and easy
on your hands and fingers. Even worse, sticking close to the native and package
bindings results in having just too many chords to make it nice to use anymore
(curiously remembering them is /never/ an issue). The mental model that I am
beginning to develop is quite simply to segregate all personal bindings into a
new key-space, conceptually, so I generally know where to put thing and where to
find things.

Articles on things like god mode [fn:25064bf0: https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode] were my first thought on how to tackle
this, but on further review it became clear pretty quickly that the best
approach for me would be to follow Xah's advice and start using more meta keys.

*** \beta Version 003

My desire is to have a pleasant key binding approach that works on all keyboards
and supports all meta keys [fn:0a59c12e: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html] supported by Emacs [fn:9d47ba99: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html]. To get
started I tracked down some examples of what I want to support for work, home,
and other:

(Still not sure how to track down one of these [fn:a7947ab7: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard]

Staring at these for a while got me thinking about the "perfect" layout and it
started to get a bit overwhelming so I set out to reduce the keys for
consideration a bit:
- Total keys: 78

Yikes. That is a lot to chew on. Thinking about how I really use the keyboard,
though, I now that some keys are not up for debate. Here is what I mean

*Keys that will remain the unchanged*
- =F= keys, 12 :: I expect them; that is what makes it a computer keyboard!
- Alphanumeric, 48 :: Numbers, letters, Symbols, Space… they are self-evaluating!
- Permanent, 1 :: This may never change. Ever. The power button!
- Frequently used, 3 :: Delete. Tab: for bash completion. ESC.
- Arrow keys, 4 :: leave the alone it is just right. It just feels wrong to
  remap it. Used in Finder. It stops videos from playing.

Remaining keys: 11. Now is when I start to look at what keys I really, really
need, that I can't live with out. All it takes is a simple question: "How often
do I actually use that key?". Additionally, because I want key balance for meta
keys, I can drop the number down to 7 because 4 of them were listed twice,
conceptually at least.

Next step is to look at the Dell keyboard and the T42 laptop to see what keys
remain in what order, and where. Following the layout from top left,
counter-clockwise, to top right looks like this. This does include keys that
I won't re-map, but I want to list them just to get a sense of the location
and remind me of how it "normally looks":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

tab
caps lock                                               return

fn control option command             command option left up down right
#+END_QUOTE

The Dell:

control alt command             command option menu control
#+END_QUOTE

The T42:

fn control alt                       alt control left/down/up/right
#+END_QUOTE

Taking a peek at the more modern HP laptop and W540 I find 4 keys available
on that bottom row, just like on the Mac. This is something to think about.
I don't want to design around the past, but at the same time I would like to
have the option of things being mapped nicely regardless of the machine and
keyboard… it is just more flexible. At the same time I don't want to be
trapped in the past… and at the very same time I do not want to be beholden
to an external keyboard. Here is what I decided to do…

- Assumption :: there are only 3 usable keys on each side of the bottom row.
  This will work for perhaps all machines and hardware out there and the
  decision will be final. Now I need to figure out the plan.

Having had some really good experience with KeyMapper [fn:2eddf385: https://code.google.com/p/keymapper/] on Windows and
KeyRemap4MacBook [fn:fd24680f: https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/] on OSX I am feeling very confident and adventurous
on pursuing an quite aggressive remap that looks like this:
- Caps lock :: control
- Shift :: option (alt, meta)
- Command :: command, pretzel, windows
- Something :: hyper

That takes care of all of the meta keys but leaves stranded:
- Shift
- Return
- Caps lock

And I'm not sure what to do with:
- Fn

Then I actually tried setting this up, on OSX!

Working through this was quite educational, here is what worked and here is
what didn't:
- Hyper :: I never figured out what key to use for this. Oops. Fn seemed like
  a good option until I reminded myself that I like to use the function key for
  stuff like volume and screen brightness, so that was out.
- Shift :: when I remapped shift to meta, sometimes it worked right in Emacs
  and sometimes it just inserted "control" into the buffer. There is an answer,
  but I chose not to pursue it right now. This alone felt too far off into a
  path too far off the mainstream.
- Enter :: it was horrible trying to use the tiny, bottom option key or enter

This has been a good experience and it led to my new/old/new configuration that
was basically a slight improvement, that will basically work everywhere, and is
in fact not very radical.

*** Version 003

The story is still simple, yet powerful… the definition of elegance!

First, leave every mapping alone, keep it fresh from scratch and an Emacs and
OS perspective.
- Modifier keys:
  - caps lock \rarr control
  - control \rarr caps lock
  - option/alt \rarr option/alt
  - command/windows \rarr command/windows

Second, find a way to make enter key send enter when pressed act as control when
held. We really lucked out here, and bbatsov already figured this out for us
here [fn:3ceb1dec: http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/06/emacs-tip-number-7-remap-return-to-control-in-osx/]. It is kind of cool that many of us will reach the same conclusion
as him, and of course also that he graciously blogged the solution. Yet to be
done is to find a good solution for Windows and Linux.

Third, super will be provided by option/alt… this is a good choice, as it is used
elsewhere for a similar intent, at least in OSX and Windows (windows key). This
symmetrical bindings supports quite easy and uniform access to a grand total of
46 keys. That is all with a single key chord! Great to know. Very nice.
Doh!… as I never though to inquire about this before.

Fourth, that leaves hyper. Who wants to ditch hyper? I don't. We need a key for
it. It would be nice to have symmetry, and by that measure alone I'm not sure
where to put it. Fn lives on OSX and Windows keyboards, but I want that. All
of the other keys I was looking at have their place and use, and I'm not
ditching them. That leaves one place, the F keys. F1 and F12 are open. Would it
nice to use them for super? Would it be horrible? Is it even possible? Well,
not really. This article [fn:62375e3d: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/02/08/mastering-key-bindings-emacs/] explains the notion of reserved keys, and how
F1-F4 are not available, thus negating the chance to have balanced hyper on each
side using F keys. That is OK. That is sticking with my philosophy of "close to
the original" and I feel like it is very OK since we have 46 keys available to
find, and bind.

*** Version 004

**** Beginnings

Being able to succed, at anything, requires a goal. During the pursuit of the
goal, the pursuer changes, and thus, so does the goal itself. My goal in this
section was to capture this iterative process so that I may see how it
developed.

Two ideas had been lingering for me:
- How to automate key binding configuration and how
- How to define as simpler, and cleaner philosophy

The /good/ things that keep coming to mind are simple:
- Stay close to the default bindings,
  - Already know them
  - Documentation is plentiful
  - Others may use
- Honor the default bindings
  - If possible, never alter them
  - Inform the operator when they /are/ changed
- Honor operator actions
  - Recognize how they use the keyboard
  - Conserve their energy
- Honor operator preferences
  - Everyone is different
  - Find a general approach that may work for all

With those values in mind, incluidng all of the exploration that came before it
on this topic, providence stepped in.

**** Studies

Providence, stepped in, kindly, and gently, to point me in the right direction.

***** MASTERING KEY BINDINGS IN EMACS

First, Micky stepped in [fn:1e82e0ca: http://www.masteringemacs.org/about/] with a potent summary [fn:813a86e6: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/02/08/mastering-key-bindings-emacs/] of where to
begin mastering your key-bindings. This is /critical/.

- Grokking =self-insert-command= helps grok the notion of compos-ability
- 3 key categories
  - undefined key :: does nothing
  - prefix key :: =C-x= and =C-c=, compose complete keys
  - complete key :: when input, executes
- Some useful key mod commands
  - =define-key=
  - =local-set-key=

***** Custom Global Emacs Bindings with Key Chord and the Semi-Colon Key

Justin posted this [fn:2ee00686: http://blog.waymondo.com/2013-01-14-custom-global-emacs-bindings-with-key-chord-and-the-semi-colon-key/] his approach here, and I think that I understood
his goals. His comment that:

#+begin_quote
learning Emacs and molding it with lisp is a great creative exercise
#+end_quote

is *spot on*.

His advice on how to use key-chord mode [fn:c2b99825: https://github.com/emacsmirror/key-chord] also struck a note with me:

#+begin_quote
this is basically an empty binding namespace…
you can use the most memorable mnemonic letters…
You don’t have muck around with overriding or conflicting with command prefixes between lisp packages or memorizing multi-command. You also don’t have to rely on bindings involving the super key (⌘ in OSX), which may conflict with system-level bindings…
The biggest consideration to make when defining chords in general is to stray from key combinations you might accidentally fire when typing away.…
#+end_quote

Justin shared a concise bit of wisdom that is, like most things you will find in
this community, a pleasure to consume.

EmacsWiki shared some details [fn:3ff9e6d0: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord], too:
- The term /key chord/
  - Is specific to using this mode
  - Is two keys pressed simultaneously
  - Or is a single key pressed twice quickly
- Use the thumb a lot, it is strong!
- Avoid chords common to how you "write"

Of course, Magnar already knew [fn:bd585bda: http://emacsrocks.com/e07.html], yet further evidence that all of his
vlog are required viewing.

***** =key-chord.el= [fn:72c0e29d: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el]

Many times, the source /is/ required-reading, too
- =key-chord-define-global=
- =key-chord-define=
- Everything that I noted in the blog posts is started in the code itself!
- Recommends that chords only involve two fingers on one hand to keep it fast
  - Interesting because I was asserting that two-hands would be fine since I
    use the control key plenty of times, and it would keep the key space open
  - Wonder how important this one is
- You can't use function, control, or non-English letters
- Only 2 keys are supported!

***** Emacs: How to Define Keys

This article [fn:a1884397: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/keyboard_shortcuts.html] will serve many:
- One may define bindings of:
  - A single key sequence of single keys
  - Key combinations
  - Sequence of single/combo keys
- Keys to Avoid (rebinding)
  - Control characters :: that may be represented by a =C-?=
  - =F1= or =C:h= :: they hep!
  - =ESC= or =C:[=  :: complicated meanings
  - =C:up S:letter]= :: doesn't work in terminals
  - =C:m= or =Enter=  :: they are linked
  - =C:i= or =TAB=  :: they are linked
- There are so many keys that if you define your own then you are probably doing
  it wrong
- Good Key Choices
  - Someone else has thought through all of this, /too/, then!
  - Always good :: F5-F9, F11-F12
  - Usually good :: F1-F4, but not F10
  - Excellent (check OS use) :: C:F1 - C:F12
  - Excellent (check OS use) :: M:F1 - M:F12
  - Excellent (check OS use) :: S:F1 - S:F12
  - Excellent (if you don't use =digit-argument=) :: C-# and M-#
  - Numeric pad and page navigation keys :: maybe
  - Super and hyper :: all good
- So that is how you may enter diacritics

***** A Curious Look at GNU Emacs's 1000+ Default Key-binding

Something of a diversion for me having covered stuff elsewhere, but this [fn:6fadaac5: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/gnu_emacs_keybinding.html]
is a nice to know, too:
- The fact that =F1= is bound to help really reveals how thoughtful Emacs was
  provided for its users
- Special symbols are nice to know about, I've always used =ucs-insert= and this
  might be a nicer option, even for guillemots.
- F
  - 3 starts a macro recording
  - 4 ends or runs it
  - 10 opens the menu bar

***** Emacs Key-binding: the Power of Key Sequences

More [fn:1cf01e80: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_keybinding_power_of_keys_sequence.html] from Xah's great pool of Emacs wisdom. Something great to think
about when you design your layout:
- Yet another key-space
- Use these when there is discontinuity in your in your editing
- Choose F keys when you need a break

**** Discussion

Wow. Learned so much. Thought a lot, too. Xah's list of /god keys/ alone would
be enough of a place to finish because it opens up the key-space so much without
requiring anything more than the /default/ Emacs setup. Sticking with that is really
kind of intriguing, but for the fact that you are still /always/ going to be using
meta keys. Defining your own key sequences, though, opens the door for faster
approaches. Combining the two sounds interesting, too.  /This/ is where key-chord
starts to get really interesting in the sense that it opens up new venues for thoughtfully choosing, or defining, a sort of meta-key, any-how that you wish.
Very cool.

**** Assumptions

The key-chord package will /just work/ in the same manner that every other built-in
Emacs feature /just works/.

**** The plan

- Tenets
  - 99.999% of the time, leave /stock bindings/ alone
  - Never use
    - =C-c=
    - =C-x=
    - =F1= - =F-4=
    - Home key chords :: asdf-\rarr or jkl;\larr gives 12x8=96 bindings!
      - Upon thinking this through, decided not worth the trouble because typing
        quickly would trigger the chords
  - Initially, focus on global mappings to "keep it easy"
- Proximity
  - *CLOSE* (continuity keys)
    - Use alphanumeric/symbol key-chords when
    - The combination is obvious… like ".." \rarr "…"
    - There is *no* chance that it could inadvertently be pressed; recalling that
      /both/ directions must be considered
    - Excluding alphanumeric leaves; =` - = [ ] \ ; ' , . /=
    - Likely offenders: =- = ; ' , .=
    - Leaving: =` [ ] \ /=
    - Left hand: 12x5
    - Right hand only: 7x5
    - 95 possible if this is right
    - Preferences: [, ], \…
    - Likelihood of usage? low
      - Choosing a global mapping that works in all modes will involve a lot of
        work
      - Tough to choose these when =META= keys are easily within reach instead
  - *NEAR*
    - Goal is to minimize finger travel
    - Keys used most frequently
    - In order of preference:
    - C-#keys :: 10
    - C-F keys :: 6 (3 easily in reach on one hand)
  - *FAR* (discontinuity keys)
    - Super:any-one :: (12+10+11+26)=59
  - *FURTHER*
    - Use =[S|C|M|S]F:5+= keys :: 8x4=32 bindings

200+ bindings (stated C-F keys extra for easy reach =-ers=), that is fine.

**** The result

1. Preference in terms of frequent use, is ease of use:
- =C-#=
- =M-#=
- =C-F=
- =M-F=

2. In the process, realized that I didn't consider using upper case letters to
   chord with! One may argue that defeats the purpose. I argue that it makes
   S serve as a quasi =META= key and that is fine because for some reason,
   mentally, it makes more sense, and feels a bit different from a =META= key which
   has a slightly different intent.

3. It might involve re-training the operator, because unlikely things, like
   typing in all caps, can muck with desires for using key-chords like =META=.

4. Chords exactly right next to each other are definitely just nice and pleasant
   to press.

5. The ease of access becomes quite clear. For me it is =C-[123]= and C-90[-] that
   are quite easy to reach. Good to know and note, note sure how though yet.

6. Choosing a place to map from, in terms of the distraction level,  kind of
   an odd experience. I had ideas about how the "disruption level" would be all
   that was needed to figure out where/how to provide a mapping. That was mostly
   true, and is still the case, but I just had a surprise where once I learned
   about how useful ace-jump is /all the time/, I realized that I must somehow have
   a home key chord. Previously, I had determined that there is no point because
   of the assumptions to bother using English language keys. Staring at the
   keyboard though, with this new understanding of the power of this mode, it
   became really simple: =d= and =f= (or =f= and =d=) are rarely if ever used
   together, so clearly that is the right place for a key-chord for ace-jump!

7. My ideas, some were good, some were not. Interesting to see how they pan out
   and develop in the log here. It almost does seem like anything *not* involving
   vowels may be a good candidate for a key-chord. I initially just didn't want to
   have to think about it, especially during an active touch-typing
   spoken-language even. Whatever happens, I'm trying to keep an open mind and let
   it develop organically.

8. Realized today that since I use =vc-next= and =er/expand-region= *so* much that
   they should be even *closer* to home. Fixed that.

9. Looking at the version control mappings to s-d… that was a relatively easy
   key combo, and naturally it ended up with the choices all occurring on the
   right hand. That was almost without thinking.

10. Another idea of name-spacing is to use sequences of letters that are
    meaninful. This [fn:75b55499: https://aaronhawley.livejournal.com/29311.html]
    articles covers something that I never though to do: C-c word. Simple.
    Instead of limiting it to meta sequences, like C-x C-e, just do C-x ce!

11. Just added a key-chord for =a'= because I do that *all the time*.
    Left-control and ' are already used, and this just popped into my mind.
    Perhaps it is obvious?

12. =TAB= loves to be used by different modes. Better just leave it exlusively
    for =auto-complete=. That keeps things really, really simple. =TAB=
    completes stuff. Other than in =org= mode, everywhere else this remains true.

13. It is worth mentioning /again/ that it it is a *really good* idea to keep your
    keybindings pretty close to stock. When you are on someone else's machine,
    or you are debugging your system, and you can't use your highly tweaked set
    up, and still need to use =emacs=, they knowing most of the default bindings
    really pays off! I always run into this when I want to use the lightweight
    and minimal system defined in this document for debugging. This has served
    me well because when I am using IntelliJ or VisualStudio I can /still/ use
    use Emacs keybindings! The former is superb, the latter is not, though.

14. On OSX, option-command bindings are used for a lot of things by applications.
    Although it would be nice to use super-meta, it is not worth borking the
    built in bindings to do so.

15. Using shift for hyper continues to be tantalizing, but then what is the
    simplest way to handle brackets that I hit a million times? That is a good
    question and perhaps I will some day have an answer.

16. Recently read this [fn:61198ad1:        http://endlessparentheses.com/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html]
    article. Not
    having been sure how to manage the growing keybindings, I've been keeping my
    eye out for a nice approach and I think that this is it. My previous idea was to
    do a graphical rendering of bindings per mode to make sense of it, but this
    seems to be a better and simpler approach. It is not urgent, but when the time
    comes this is the approach that I will try. Here [fn:f20493c8: http://endlessparentheses.com/launcher-keymap-for-standalone-features.html]
    is another discussion alluding to the same approach. Right now I do the same
    thing with plain old bindings like =s-u dsr= for "unicode double-stroke R".

17. Lately I've refactored this document a bit to make it easier for me (the human)
    to manage. Something really basic: tagging =noweb-ref= blocks with a disposable
    name like =ignore= to make it easy to work with them in their source language
    without tangling. That change is not exactly a keyboard thing, but it is
    related. That slowed things down a tiny bit. However, it made things so much
    more flexible *AND* understandable. I guess this is my experiential proof?
    The only way I can make sense of the tangled document is becuase of this document.
    The context, the story, everything, is in here. Without it, the tangled document
    is nearly useless because no one could ever make sense of it. Making sense of it
    makes it very easy to change. When you have a map and a context, you can make
    changes very quickly. This makes it easy to make mistakes, which is a great way
    to learn. The key-chord map is one example. I erroneously chose =df= for =goto-line=.
    Actaully, when it chose it, it was perfect! That was before =ess= and typing =df= for
    datatframe all over in the code. Ouch. Well, life changes, and we adapt. That
    is what is so cool about this document; it lets you adapt easily! I make changes
    with no fear because I can make sense of things. I have my notes, my context,
    my reason, my idea, and a real biggie, results of previous experiements. It is
    easy to love this approach. Something that came out of playing, or experimentation
    perhaps sounds better, is seeing that for key chords it is a little easier to know
    what to do. Eg, I use English, so consonant-vowel combinations are easy to avoid.
    Once in a while ones like =df= will pop up and I will deal with it. A minor
    one to avoid perhaps are abbreviations from when you remove vowels, that has not
    me. Not a big deal, but identifying obvious chords one will never type like
    =fg= is a nice to do.

** How to choose a font

Audience: Computer users. Programmers. User experience designers (UXD).

Every computer-user has a different strategy for choosing the best font for long
periods working at the computer. They all involve many metrics, strategies, and
rubrics. Based on that, they are probably all wrong. Well not really, they are
right based upon experience, and experience is really all that matters.

I was curious about whether my experience had any basis in reality, and I really
wanted to dig into what is the "right way" to choose a font for any particular
user or situation. The following are notes and ultimately a decision on what is
the best for me. Hopefully the notes alone are revealing and help you reach your
own conclusion, too. At the very least you ought to be educated, informed, and
probably surprised, too, about some of the factors involved in font selection.

Designed for screen: Verdana, Trebuchet MS, and (the serif) Georgia.

Easy to read, available on virtually all machines.

Let go of times new roman, Arial, and Helvetica.

Traditionally a serif font was used for the main body of a document, and
sans-serif for headings. Today, those principles are often reversed.

[[http://www.awaionline.com/2011/10/the-best-fonts-to-use-in-print-online-and-email/][The Best Fonts to Use in Print, Online, and Email]]

Popular serif fonts are Times New Roman, Palatino, Georgia, Courier,
Bookman and Garamond.

Some popular San Serif fonts are Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, Century
Gothic and Verdana.

It's been said that serif fonts are for "readability," while sans-serif
fonts are for "legibility."

Best fonts for online: go with sans-serif.

2002 study by the Software Usability and Research Laboratory:
- The most legible fonts were Arial, Courier, and Verdana.
- At 10-point size, participants preferred Verdana. Times New Roman was
  the least preferred.
- At 12-point size, Arial was preferred and Times New Roman was the
  least preferred.
- The preferred font overall was Verdana, and Times New Roman was the
  least preferred.

For easiest online reading, use Arial 12-point size and larger. If
you're going smaller than 12 points, Verdana at 10 points is your best
choice. If you're after a formal look, use the font "Georgia." And for
older readers, use at least a 14-point font.

Dr. Ralph F. Wilson, an e-commerce consultant, did a series of tests in
2001. He also came to the conclusion that the sans-serif fonts are more
suited to the computer screen.Some of the highlights of the test results
were that at 12 points, respondents showed a preference for Arial over
Verdana -- 53% to 43% (with 4% not being able to distinguish between the
two).Two-thirds of respondents found that Verdana at 12 points was too
large for body text, but Verdana at 10 points was voted more readable
than Arial at 10 points by a 2 to 1 margin.In conclusion, for the best
font readability, use Arial 12 point or Verdana at 10 points and 9
points for body text. For headlines, he suggests using larger bold
Verdana.

Comments: Good.

Post: Advice to use san-serif is outdated and inappropriate for today's
high resolution screens. San-serif or not is irrelevant; instead the
measure of success is to use a large font that was specifically designed
for on-screen usage. For inspiration, look at the free fonts listed at
the Google Web Fonts directory, especially Vollkorn or the Droid Serif
font which was particularly developed with small font size in mind.

Legibility refers to being able to read a text in bad conditions.
“Legibility is concerned with the very fine details of typeface design,
and in an operational context this usually means the ability to
recognize individual letters or words. Readability however concerns the
optimum arrangement and layout of whole bodies of text”

Studies that contrast serif vs. non-serif fonts seem to be
controversial.

There are some ground rules one can find, like:
- Don't make long lines nor too long paragraphs
- Use wide fonts such as Palatino or Verdana for small fonts
- Use spaces between lines, e.g. about 1.2 at least. E.g. in Word 2007,
  1.15 is the default I believe. to be controversial.

Sans serif: Verdana (a humanist font) or Arial

Serif: Georgia

Some references for studies and research done on fonts.

“two roles for type: a functional role (relating to legibility) and an
aesthetic/semantic role, which impacts the "apparent 'fitness' or
'suitability' for different functions, and which imbue it with the power
to evoke in the perceiver certain emotional and cognitive response" (p.
38)””

In her study: Calibri came out as a winner against Courier New and Curlz.

I only read this article months after reading the bulk of references in this
section. It took time it to sink and for me to accept it. It is so easy to
produce a letter in LaTeX, and just send a PDF. It should really be printed,
though. So, what is the right medium and what is the right font? For formal
things, things worth writng, I say paper.

*** Thoughts

- Ideals
- Current state of technology along with aging-eyes means that
  sans-serif is the best option
- Emacs suggest mono-spaced fonts for coding
- Experienced teaches me that Unicode support is mandatory
- Matching
- Prefer fonts that focus on legibility over emotional evocation
- Results: Verdana, Calibri, Tahoma, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans
  Console
- Notes: [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_unicode_fonts.html][Best Unicode Fonts for Programming]]
- DejaVu Sans Mono: best Unicode support
- Based on Andale Mono, a monospaced san-serif designed for coding
- [[http://www.slant.co/topics/67/viewpoints/4/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts~dejavu-sans-mono][What are the best programming fonts?]]
- Tons of coding related fonts. Why not for reading?!
- Source Code Pro is highest ranked, then Consolas, and Monaco
- [[http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30040/Font-Survey-42-of-the-Best-Monospaced-Programming][Font Survey: 42 of the Best Monospaced Programming Fonts]]
- The options, although only 42, are insanely overwhelming.
  - Comments
  - There isn't a ton of digestible info available on Unicode support for
    the fonts that I listed.
  - I am recalling now that my original selection of DejaVu Sans Mono was
    specifically for its excellent Unicode support; specifically that it
    had better support than Lucida Console which is monospaced but lacked
    characters and looks at least as nice.
  - Seems like it is just haphazard and quasi-scientific how people are
    choosing fonts; and maybe even designing them.
  - Founds evidence that Lucida is just fine for display; and thus
    DejaVu Sans Mono is fine for display.
- Conclusion
  - DejaVu Sans Mono is the best available font for computer work.

** Ponderings

*** Make things "secure by default"  [fn:8eb87c09: https://www.openbsd.org/security.html]

Your artifacts may end up in use anywhere by anyone. Create an environment where
the default configuration is also the most secure configuration. For example,
provide HTTPS links over HTTP, and think about what code may run and what it may
do. This approach, while admittedly valuable, is inherently at odds with the
fundamental mission of a software developer: to enable. Respect both sides of the
coin, and you will suffer less.

*** What it means to test

Testing is like flossing, everybody knows why it is important, agrees that it
is important, and even wants to do it… yet does not. Your job is to create an
environment where people want to test. The first step is to define a measure of
success.

In order to succeed, one must have a measure. Although arbitrary, measures must
be made. Think through the problem, the original goals, and the newly understood
constraints. All of those things will define the measure of success.

Guided by that measure (or constraint), then you may go about creating an
environment that is pleasant and facilitate the achievement of those goals.
Practices like breathing practices and meditation will serve one well here.

*** Practice

The old tenet that practice makes perfect couldn't be any more true here. In the
cycle of learning, you learn the tools, the problem, then apply them, and then,
the tools and Tc problem change you, and the cycle repeats. Lisp programmers who
have invested in code-generation (macros) know this well, and yet are constantly
surprised when it occurs yet again. In the same style, working with literate
programs grows and blossoms in unexpected directions. Though some are painful
and irritating; the common thread among all of them is that they all lead
somewhere wonderful. With time and practice, you will find yourself not only
maintaining things you never intended, but simultaneously pondering and
realizing things you had never intended, either. That trip is delightful.

*** Understanding how to use the tools

Tools alone are meaningless. Experience and knowing how to use those tools means
everything. A simple example is doing GUi diffs before a commit. Often GUI tools
are shunned quite needlessly here. They can make stuff quite focused and simple.
For example, while doing a refactoring, comment out what is not needed, make
the change, test it, then do the diff, to verify what you expect, and then do
the commit. Remove the commented out code before that commit, or after, it is up
to you. The GUI diff tool may be nice here in that it uses standard (to the tool)
colors to indicate the type of change that has occurred making it very, very
clear as to your intent, too. Is it a perfect approach? No, not at all, but it
is very, very nice sometimes.

*** Audience

A question that every document author must both ask themselves, and
consequently answer, "for whom am I creating this document?". At one's day job,
it is easy: the stakeholder. In our personal life though, most of use don't get
into habit of viewing ourselves as the stakeholder, or our family and friends,
either. We would be well served to do so, though. One's personal life is a
safe, non-trivial place to learn how to better ourselves. Starting with
ones-self is a perfect place to start. That is not to say that starting with
others isn't also great, it just wasn't the right place for me.

Originally I wanted to create a document explaining to others my goal for this
document. That was a honest yet ultimately misguided effort, because I didn't
know where it was going. At the beginning, I had a very different belief system.
My intention of focusing on those things was good, it just needed to be
simplifies and re-focused upon doing that work for myself. At delivery time,
I am the single stakeholder and all efforts should be focused there. Where is
there?

There is in me, a flawed, irrational, and illogical human being. Quite common,
actually, but we still like them. The document that I must deliver has to
account for all of those things, and help me to achieve my goals.

** Philosophy

A favorite fable is that of the human who upon reaching the afterlife, meeting
his Holiness, vented his frustration exclaiming "All this time… for my whole
life I begged to you that I wanted to win the lottery! And you, you never let
me win, it would have made my life so, so much better. You failed me". With a
kind heart and a sweet voice, his Holiness explained "My child, I did let you
win, you just never bothered to get off you ass to go and purchase the ticket".
That is certainly a favorite of mine, it captures a specific idea quite
succinctly and humorously: that effort is required.

These days, at least here in America, a land of great, great prosperity, the most
prosperous people have grown lazy and selfish. A sense of entitlement abounds,
surrounds, and consumes them. This disposition reveals itself in every action
that they take ranging from beliefs on public policy and whether or not to
donate money to the needy all they way down to their day jobs.

Nearly all of the great technologies on which the modern world is built, at
least from a software perspective, occurred due to the efforts of great
individuals, who may be broadly and perhaps unfairly lumped under the singular
umbrella of The Free Software Foundation [fn:aa5631ac: https://www.fsf.org/].

Sadly most computer professionals today, especially developers, make a
non-trivial percentage of their income using the artifacts produced by the
combined efforts of others, yet give little to nothing back to that community.
From the simplest form of contributing money, all the way down the cheapest form
of simply promoting its values, most people are too lazy and selfish. Honestly,
I understand though, I used to be that way, too. The important thing is that it
is never too late too change.

Our mind is here to be used; fight laziness. Our efforts are here, to help
contribute to and serve others; always give back to your community no matter
what it may be.

** The desire

"I want". If only all conversations would start out with a clear goal in mind.
All too often we waste our own, and other people's time talking and simply
trying to figure out what it is what we want. For most of us, "it", is that
thing that will solve all of our problems in life and make us happy. Technology
is no exception.

The perfect integrated development environment is a topic of constant
conversation. For good reason, for most of us it is our only tool. Unlike
carpenters and wood-workers who have a bevy of interesting and delightful tools,
we are stuck with but one. Fortunately for us, our singular tool allows
limitless creation, of tools and more. Alan Kay said it so well [fn:2e3b75ad: https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rpjames/]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The computer is a medium that can dynamically simulate the details of any other
medium, including media that cannot exist physically. It is not a tool, although
it can act like many tools. The computer is the first metamedium, and as such it
has degrees of freedom for representation and expression never before
encountered and as yet barely investigated. The protean nature of the computer
is such that it can act like a machine or like a language to be shaped and
exploited.
#+END_QUOTE

Even more succinctly, my measure of success is to:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
To provide a self-suportable environment in which the creation and conservation
of computer files may occur with ease
#+END_CENTER

As of writing, although there are many nice options out there, none of them
come within even light-years, of power that you are granted for working with a
computer as that metamedium, that GNU Emacs [fn:54b16b1c: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/]. With that in mind,
the following is what I actually want to do with it.

** The preparation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening
the axe. [fn:0df28444: http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/abrahamlin109275.html]
#+END_QUOTE

Even better, configure Emacs properly and you will end up with a light-saber. It
takes investment though, and it begins with preparation. For me, that meant
getting some real life experience, learning new things, getting unpleasant
phone calls when systems went down, and perhaps most importantly forcing myself
outside my comfort zone.

We work so hard to become experts, yet as a result of it, we close our eyes to
new possibility and techniques and approaches, that when combined with our
existing experience, could help us to produce some really beautiful things. That
experience is often reflected in the love, adoration, and respect held collectively
for the Lambda papers [fn:bc605346: http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html].

At its simplest, reading about Emacs and org-mode are a perfectly fine place to
start with this kind of a document.

** Expressivity

Words are our fundamental form of persistent communication. Images and music are
quite delightful for other kinds of communication, but usually not for data. At
this point, Unicode is the best option for symbolic representation of ideas, and
its use should be embraced, and expected by all programmers.

** The story

The creativity that you apply and capture to assemble your system… this is where
all of the fun stuff is. Let me elaborate, everything in your artifacts are
valuable because they tell the story. Actually, they tell the story about a
story, a story that has yet to occur and also a story that has previously
occurred. It is here, where the actions lives, that all of those things are
learned, practiced, suffered accordingly from, and reveled in! In other words,
it is yet another story, a fun one.

If you haven't noticed by now, either by hearing rumors, reading accounts, or
learning of it yourself: human beings are story-oriented. Your ability to
successfully function in and contribute to society will be directly proportional
to your ability to listen to stories, tell others' stories, live your life such
that you have new stories to tell, and capture them in some form of persistent
storage. Stories grant us the power to learn from others wisdom that was
painfully acquired thousands of years ago, and it gives you a chance to
contribute the results of your hard work, for the future of humanity, too. A
belief system about the value of story-telling is essential, critical, and
mandatory to successfully achieve your goals with literate programming.

As I change, the story will change, and the action will change. The cycle will
never end.

Nevertheless, I will attempt to do my best here with the good part of me being
a flawless, rational, and logical human being to:

- Deliver a supportable system
- Deliver an adaptable system
- Deliver an expandable system

** Inspirations

** Analytics [fn:671bb778: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics]

*** Introduction

Analytics is the focused, integrated, and comprehensive application of
mathematics, statistics, and computer science in order to facilitate making
decisions. In the context for this document, the question that needs to be
answered is simple:

#+begin_quote
How may I make better use of my time?
#+end_quote

In particular while using Emacs.

How may I be using Emacs?
- =TC3F=
- Programming
- Time-tracking
- Web-browsing
- Emailing

So what is my plan for answering that question? First, I ought to consider or
even define some scope.

This pursuit began out of the confluence of two /events/: studying Computational
Science and mastering Emacs. Initally, they were disconnected but as time went
on the opportunity for the latter to serve as the perfect laboratory for the
former became quite obvious. In this single environment one may track everything
that one does, when, and how from a very simple and consistent perspective.

More work needs to be done here:
- How to track?
- What analysis will be performed?
- What else may be captured here?

Always remember what Bob Dylan esposed to all data scientists:

*** Data collection

Xah posted here [fn:3a3c1b68: http://xahlee.info/kbd/list_of_keylogging_software.html]
on some approachs so I skimmed them.

selfspy [fn:406ee896: https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy]
- UN*X, OSX, and Windows support
- Great links
- Looks like all your actions are stored in a local SQLite database
- It is a Python app using SqlAlchemy
- May answer questions:
  - What can I use it for?
    - Anything, it is your data
  - Browser just threw away everything I wrote. What did I write?
    - Look at text for the last 30m
  - What is my password for a website?
    - Search for what you typed into Chrome for a website
  - What did I work on for the past few days?
    - Searchwhat you did in Emacs and what buffers
  - How much have I used this computer all week?
    - Can do
  - Effectivity?
    - Looks at keays per active second
  - What did I write about a printer and IP on some day to her?
    - Can search that granulary
  - What programs to I use the most?
    - Can do
  - "Which questions on the website Stack Overflow did I visit yesterday?"
  - "How much have I browsed today?"
  - "While we are at it, which cpp files have I edited the most this month?"
- Remember that it is SQL so you can do whatever you please
- Data abouse mouse click coordinates and window geometry is also stored
- Author posits sending yourself email weekly on how much you moused versus
  how much you typed. Wow.
- Thoughts
  - This is all Python
  - Database is file based as assume it may be stored in Git
  - Tracks everything
  - How to handle across users?

logkeys [fn:7256ed34: https://code.google.com/p/logkeys/]
- It only works on GNU/Linux

keyfreq [fn:48113ab3: https://github.com/dacap/keyfreq]
- Elisp that runs inside of Emacs so portable and available
- Bare-bones page
- Thoughts
  - Can read entire code
  - Single file
  - Scoped quite sharply to just commands which is what I wanted

Thoughts:
- There is such a difference between selfspy and keyfreq
  - Good and bad difference
  - Where to begin
- How to handle different accounts but same confi?

[[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/command-frequency.html][Emacs's Command Frequency Statistics]]
- Perfect
- Exactly what I wanted for one case
*** In use

In use this is really simple:
- It occurs for private, personal use
- And nothing more

This is the simplest humanly possible way to make this be right, just, and fair.

** Reminders

- *NEVER* edit source blocks outside of their editor mode
  - *Guaranteed* issues will occur if it is LISP
- Treat source blocks amazingly delicately and thoughtfully
  because if you don't then you will break your system
- The flow is
  - First make the new changes directly in the code
  - Verify that they work
  - *Then* place them in this document
- Only use in-line footnotes unless your document is very very small
  - Footnotes in org-mode are really, really great. Before you really get into using
    them, take a bit of time to think about how you want to use them.
  - If you have 5 footnotes or less, then don't think anymore about it. If more then
    read on.
  - This topic is not unique to org first of all, it just isn't something that you
    consider much until it is too late. Once you get into the org life-cycle, you start
    tossing and slinging document and code fragments with ease, especially while
    re-factoring. This is all find and well, until you realize that your footnotes will
    be left sad and alone, abandoned for some cruel fate. In particular, it will break
    your document.
  - The better way is to define them all in-line; that will allow simple and easy
    re-factoring in a quite pleasant manner.
- No comments in generated source code ever; barring a few special cases.
- Always keep every kind of URL in a form that you may tell Ispell to ignore
  else you will get lose in the jungle of spell-checking and quit doing it.
- For key, always use a finger that doesn't require a stretch or hand reposition.
  For example, I can use my "ring finger" to reach =-=, ~=~, and =DEL= so I
  should never stretch to do that with my "pinkie".
- There are modes like ergoemacs [fn:6218cfd6: https://ergoemacs.github.io/] for
  doing this gradually

* Decisions

Given values and restrictions, review, identify, and evaluate available options.

Eventually I realized that the system itself needs to be self-supportable. In
other words, stage the user for success by either leaving the system in a
runnable and usable state or notify her when something is not happy. This lesson
was learned when I spent a few hours setting up erc and somehow got the bizarre
idea that I would remember where all support files belonged (or was it dired?).
Big mistake, we don't have to remember things that computers remember for us
(or rather persistent memory). This document is consequently set up in a manner
that will provide a self-supportable user experience at nearly every level
possible.

** General stuff [fn:5fa1ff0b: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/General-Variables.html] [fn:13c610e7: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/User-Identification.html] [fn:2e194253: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Examples.html] [fn:374f40df: http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2012_07/tips-and-tricks-for-emacslisp]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :noweb-ref: general-stuff-block
    :END:

A number of variables are generally important, and are also general. Yet again
my failure to RTFM has taught me a lesson; =setq-defaul= is for buffer local variables
and =setq= is for global variables. As the manual points out, you
probably only want to be doing the former in an initialization file. Be sure to read all
the links here as they are all important. To reiterate, the most general and
reusable setting should be done in the former, and the setting specific to a
particular mode or situation should be done with the latter. At this point
I think I understand the intent, but do not yet have a good strategy to follow
for when to use them other then a very broad: for stuff that is generally a
great setting for 80% of situations, do the former; and stuff that is great
80% but only for a specific mode for example, do them latter.

=boundp= and =fboundp= are useful here,
too. Initially I had thought that general variables were the place to put most
stuff, but as their simplest they should remain external and not be managed
by my initialization scripts, so I learn towards the more specific versions here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default user-full-name "Grant Rettke"
              user-mail-address "gcr@wisdomandwonder.com")

(setq-default eval-expression-print-level nil)
(setq-default case-fold-search +1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Another notable note that touches upon why =cons= cells shouldn't be directly
manipulated:
#+begin_quote
=(info "(elisp) Rearrangement")=
#+end_quote

A common theme in the modes and before various operations is to save all
buffers. This is a desire, to have all files persisted so that everything run
/just works/. I'm not quite sure how to codify and automate this yet, but I am
on the path.

Performance, give Emacs more RAM. 1 kibibyte (KiB) [fn:58d617cb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte]
is 1024 bytes. 1 mebibyte (MiB) [fn:620a7fd4: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte]
is 1024^2 bytes, aka 1 megabyte.
- 064 MiB we'll see
- 128 MiB was intermittently irritating with garbage collection
  - And yet I come back to this because it seems to be OK
  - And then it isn't again!
- 256 MiB made the garbage collection take forever
- 512 MiB because =ess= was dog slow at times!
  - But sometimes I needs it
  - Othertimes it causes 15 seconds hangs while the GC runs
- 1024 MiB
  - Just curious
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 128 1024 1024))
#+end_src

When I tangle this file, I run out of stack space. Err, Emacs does I mean.
Probably a bug that I introduced into the document, but make it clear how much
recursion may occur here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq max-specpdl-size 1500)
#+end_src

Whenever this sytem runs I want error to be handled immediately. Elsewhere I do
bind a key to disable this. It kind of depends where this should get tangled. In
theory it should be the first line of the tangled file but I'm not going to
worry about it until I need to. This approach has generally worked out fine,
or rather had worked out fine. What I found is that not surprisingly errors do
occur! And then… they are handled! Well, not really a shocker is it? You get
the debugger starting a *lot* when it isn't really an exceptional situation. As
such, this needs to be turned off until problem do occur.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq debug-on-error nil)
#+end_src

Be sure to pay homage to Zippy every once a while by invoking him with a call
to =yow=.

** Environment
    :PROPERTIES:
    :noweb-ref: environment-block
    :END:

On OSX, I learned that when you start the GUI version of Emacs that it doesn't
inherit the =ENVIRONMENT=. This is the solution.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'exec-path-from-shell)
(gcr/on-osx (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

For a while I went on a quest to get the =Message= buffer to include time-stamps
on each entry. EmacsWiki had some decent approaches but none of them worked
right for me and I didn't want to dig further. Eventually though I got tired of
having to pay close attention to the minibuffer or =Messages= for stuff and
just started looking for GUI options. The plan is to have =Messages= for most
stuff and if there are alerts by any definition then I want that to be an
option. First choice was todochiku [fn:4f2e6828: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/todochiku] due to the high download count but
two issues, it didn't work and it is not used by anything else. Alert [fn:fd4688ce: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/alert],
on the other hand, is, and also lives on Github meaning that it is maintainable.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'alert)
(setq alert-fade-time 10)
(gcr/on-gui
 (gcr/on-osx
   (setq alert-default-style 'growl)))
(setq alert-reveal-idle-time 120)
#+end_src

On Windows, you need to specify a specific shell so that Emacs can talk to
other programs in the correct manner:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gcr/on-windows
 (setq shell-file-name "cmdproxy.exe"))
#+end_src

** Time

There are time zones that I do care to know about:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'world-time-mode)
#+end_src

** Font (Appearance)
    :PROPERTIES:
    :noweb-ref: font-decision
    :END:

The studies cited above indicate that the two major factors that contribute to
readability of a document are contrast and font-face. Sayre's law [fn:17910758: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law] however
demands that any number of other things are critical to how your IDE looks! That
is OK. This section captures some of the basics to getting the system looking
how I like it.

This is a san-serif, portable, massively Unicode supported font. You may
easily change the font size using =gcr/text-scale-increase= and
=gcr/text-scale-decrease=; font information appears in the =*Messages*= buffer
and also the mini-buffer. The font size will be the same everywhere; as it is
easier to work between graphic and console mode with that consistency. You may
bypass that using the built in functions. The color theme seems to provide
excellent contrast, though I can't decipher what the creator is actually saying
about them. For a while I went between the light and dark solarized theme, and
finally accepted that I'm happy with light for documents and dark for programs.
That is not scientific, and I'm OK with that. Fortunately you can theme per buffer.
Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work perfectly. It wasn't a big deal until it
broke org's export to HTML. Since I needed that especially for right now, I
decided to stick with the dark theme, as it is more familiar. As of this writing
there are no less than 3 packages that provide solarized. After reading their
documentation quite closely it came down something relatively simple: face
support. Trying to set up help pop-ups to look decent I noticed that =auto-complete=
and =popup= looked horrible. Reading through the different versions, there was
only one [fn:c886e5f6: https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs] package that provided so many faces that I needed and the
others did not so the decision was easy.

Sometimes you don't like how a characters looks, or don't have access to
Unicode. In such cases, pretty-mode displays substitutions for certain
occurrences of flagged strings, for example replacing the world =lambda= with
the symbol \lambda.

Based upon the above research, use the DejaVu font family.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Months and months and months after that delightful research I was stunned to
learn of [fn:6f3a8ca3: http://irreal.org/blog/?p=2828] the [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts][unicode-fonts]]. It
seems that it will make all of my Unicode dreams come true. Can't wait to fall
asleep now! One thing I am actualy really excited about is to be able to use
Emacs for Tamil and Sanskrit.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Here are the Unicode fonts that I am using, with the specific download links

To test it I ran =view-hello-file= and =M-x list-charset-chars RET unicode-bmp RET=.
It may not be the most scientific approach, but it is clear that there is more
character support then before! All of the Tamil letters are there, though I
wasn't able to download the font apparently OSX has font support built it.
Perhaps humorously, finally we have support for 💩.

Set a font size that may easily be read, on $\frac{1}{2}$ of a high resolution
screen, 80 columns wide.

** Postfix

Sometimes there are things that need to happen at the end of the configuration
of this system. Since we are not bound to defining it in any particular order,
the question must be answered as to where then to put it in here.

Since must be done at the end in regards to many areas within this document, I
think that the best place is here, and this is how. I suspect that in time I
will find a better way.

*** Permanent buffers

Emacs lets you set up buffers that won't be resized or moved. That is really a
nice option because sometimes you actually don't care. For me, I end up writing
Emacs Lisp and working in the shell so much that it finally dawned on me that I
ought to make permanenet buffers for them.

The height of the buffer is:
- 1 row for the name of the mode
- 1 row for a space between the input and the mode name
- =n= for everything else
  - there is a mininum

The buffer height it set up in the functions right now and if I end up creating
more then perhaps it would be time to refactor those hard codings.

For now, all of that code may be easily utilized via =gcr/util-cycle=.

*** Buffers [fn:595a3296: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Buffers.html#Buffers]

It is nice to have an indicator of the right column that indicates the maximum
depth of the line. My favorite package is fill-column-indicator [fn:cbacf0d5: https://github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator]. Its
use shows up in almost all of the modes. While working on this build though
the export to HTML included junk characters, so I had to disable it, at least in
Lispy modes. My final solution to be able to use this package was to generate
two Emacs configuration files, one for general use and one just for doing
exports.

Keep open files open across sessions. [fn:1d393334: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions]
You need to be really thoughtful here because =desktop-mode= stores *all* buffer
information. Most of the time this is exactly what you want and then you forgot
about it because it /just works/ so well. The trouble comes when you reconfigure
the mode and restart Emacs and those old buffer settings are re-loaded when you
really wanted the new settings loaded.

Automatically save every buffer associated with a file [fn:893e2436: http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/real-auto-save]. This is another
IntelliJ holdover. The built in auto-save in Emacs wasn't something that I
needed, and this does the right thing. There is a bit more though to it,
namely because the interval is only 20s I still want/need to be sure that
the file is saved /before/ doing anything like running code or doing a build
As such, before most operations, all buffers with files attached are saved
/first/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

The value =default-process-coding-system= seems to be set automatically, and it is

Emacs has a powerful buffer tracking change system. Unfortunately, I don't

How to jump to locations in a buffer in an easier way than by using the built
in key bindings? Science… that is how.

This package [fn:bb3b4f83: https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode] searches for the character for which you are searching at
the start of a word, highlights matches, and presents you with the letter to
press to jump to the match. You may also search in the middle of words. The key
to using this to utilize =pop-mark= to get back to where you were.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload
  'ace-jump-mode
  "ace-jump-mode"

  t)
#+end_src

A long, long time ago I saw a neat feature in Sublime Text [fn:cc16092c: http://www.sublimetext.com/] (their
zeal for their editor is great, very sweet) where you could see a miniature
version of your buffer off to the side of the buffer itself. Wasn't totally sure
what I would use it for, but it was really neat. Ended up on this [fn:4d8f7d5c: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MiniMap] page
but I didn't ant to depend upon CEDET [fn:e69c2681: http://cedet.sourceforge.net/]. Then, Sublimity [fn:a51ffddc: https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity] showed
up in a post somewhere. The timing was perfect because I was getting really
curious about a "quiet mode" that didn't show the modeline or the line numbers
or fringe, and I didn't feel like implementing it at that moment. It turns out
that this package does it all already; very cool.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'sublimity)
(require 'sublimity-scroll)
(require 'sublimity-map)
(require 'sublimity-attractive)
#+end_src

By default, the map is hidden while scrolling and this makes it work in a
responsive and pleasant manner [fn:026acd51: ttps://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity/issues/10]. It makes Emacs quite slow actually.
Unfortunately, having the map constantly disappear is really unpleasant, and the
slow down is, too. Well, this will be a balance. I'll turn it on and live with
it. The cool thing here is that you may imagine exactly how this is implemented
if you've ever set your font manually and used indirect buffers.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(sublimity-map-set-delay nil)
#+end_src

Usually you actually need two scratch buffers, one for Emacs lisp and one for
text:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((text-buffer (get-buffer-create "*text*")))
  (with-current-buffer text-buffer
    (text-mode)
    (insert "Shall we play a game?")
    (beginning-of-line)))

#+end_src

Navigating a buffer was never slow… until learning about
ace-jump-mode [fn:e4201d0c: https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode/wiki/AceJump-FAQ]. The idea is so deceptively simple, and when you grok
it, you will be truly shocked. The author sums it up quite succinctly

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload
  'ace-jump-mode
  "ace-jump-mode"
  "Emacs quick move minor mode"
  t)
(autoload
  'ace-jump-mode-pop-mark
  "ace-jump-mode"
  "Ace jump back:-)"
  t)
(eval-after-load "ace-jump-mode"

Perhaps an odd topic, but how you handle spaces when performing an interactive
search is a choice:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq isearch-lax-whitespace +1)
(setq isearch-regexp-lax-whitespace +1)
#+end_src

A lot of times you write things that involves quoting large chunks from other
documents. I'm thinking this is more spur of the moment… like in emails.
However, this may occur anywhere I suppose. Perhaps coding is another place? At
least when you are not doing LP it would be more likely. This [fn:4ab3a68a: https://github.com/davep/boxquote.el]
seems like a nice way to make it obvious when I insert quoted text:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'boxquote)
#+end_src
The more that I use this package, the more obvious it becomes how insanely
useful it is.

How you move around lines in a file is configurable. My preference is that if I
am on the end of a line, and I go up or down, then I want to go to the end of
line on that new line. Specifically, I do not want to account for anything
special about the character I am dealing with. This is what most folks would
expect:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq track-eol +1)
(setq line-move-visual nil)
#+end_src

Sometimes you want to swap two pieces of text within a buffer. This library
makes it very simple to do that by selecting what you want to swap, starting
the anchored transpose, and then choosing its destination.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [?\C-x ?t] 'anchored-transpose)
(autoload 'anchored-transpose "anchored-transpose" nil t)
#+end_src

For a long while I used =tabbar= [fn:11b925fe: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabBarMode]
and found it to be quite nice. You may easily cycle through specific types of
files and specific types of buffers of your choice. It is a very easy to use
and nice feature. Years ago, it helped me out a lot for transitioning to Emacs.
Eventually, I just no longer felt the need for it… and still I think very
highly of it. For the longest time, I would only keep a handful of buffers open.
It was probably because of my VIMentality. That is what everyone says,
attributing everything to the editor that they are using. It was really my
choice though not the editor's choice! Nonetheless, with time, I was able to
leave more buffers open and got more curious about them, so I first turned
to =buffer-menu=, and soon wanted more. How much more? I didn't know, and I
still don't, but I will use =ibuffer= [fn:167d949c: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IbufferMode] [fn:29b94e55: http://emacs-fu.blogspot.fr/2010/02/dealing-with-many-buffers-ibuffer.html]
to let me do it. Joking aside, purcell's approach [fn:e46c420a: https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-vc]
to group buffer's by their vc
root directory and show their vc status. This is kind of a dream come true, that
is exactly what I had wanted. Every time you need something good, purcell
already has a solution for it. This workflow is nearly identical to how I use
stathon [fn:d801c7b7: https://github.com/grettke/stathon], the only difference
being that the latter knows about all files rather than file just open in the
buffer. Perhaps =projectile= will grow to include something that reports vc
status? Let me check. =projectile-vc= is pretty close!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ibuffer)
#+end_src

Having the buffer move up and down one line at a time is generally nice and fine
(especially with a mouse). It is really unpleasant though when you get up to or
down into the next page while scolling with the cursor because the entire
contents of you screen just *jump* quite uncomfortably. My preference here is to
keep the cursor 10 lines or so from the top or the bottom. This is a preference
that cycles over the years… but I always come back to turning it on again.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'smooth-scrolling)

Dealing with markup that uses tags is pretty easy per-mode as you do it once and
you are done. In modes liks =org= though you tend to have more evolutionary steps
in your document so you end up wrapping things after the fact a lot.
=wrap-region= [fn:fd94462d: https://github.com/rejeep/wrap-region.el] makes this
easy, fast, and intuitive. Well it lets /you/ do it, which is just as good!

Thoughts:
- Should mode setting be defined here?
  - Will try for now
- Should =wrap-region-remove-wrapper= be specified?
  - Won't for now can just undo.

**** Line Wrapping [fn:46bfb076: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Visual-Line-Mode.html] [fn:210: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/VisualLineMode] / Line breaking [fn:0945b707: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Auto-Fill.html]

A long time ago I disabled line-wrapping because I kept all of my files less
than 80 lines and life was simple. This approach actually worked fine for a
long, long time, that was until it quit working well, when I started working on
Emacs a lot of the time on different machines with different resolutions.
Perhaps there was more too it then this, but I really don't recall. Reading up
on it now, it seems that there is a nice option built in and I didn't have
much to consider other than to capture my decisions on how I want the wrapping
to work. Basically I don't want indicators since I have line numbers it is
obvious, and I will just make the mode global and disable it in cases where I
need to do so. Reading up on it more I figured that enabling it for text modes
was the simplest thing, and I'll tweak it from there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-visual-line-mode 1)
(gcr/diminish 'visual-line-mode)
(gcr/diminish 'global-visual-line-mode)
#+end_src

Another option available to us is to /simply/ break the line once it reaches a
preset length using Auto fill mode. One might break all lines at 80 characters
for example. Although that is a nice option, I prefer dealing with it manually
so I know what is happening in any particular buffer, and visual line mode makes
that loads easier.

Learning and mastering what is available and possible with Emacs takes time.
This article [fn:fd742067: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2013/12/21/discoverel-discover-emacs-context-menus/]

*** File-system management

Not quite sure where this should go yet. Finder is [fn:dbe73f8c: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)] is just fine (Fine-der?), and
the curiosity is still there for an in-Emacs solution. Speedbar [fn:c05b9cba: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SpeedBar] and
SrSpeedbar [fn:41a6cbbc: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SrSpeedbar] look nice, as does [fn:8cc3a263: https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree]. The thing is though that
with stuff like =projectile=, you really don't need to worry about hierarchical
filesystem navigation anymore. Instead, it is the familiarity that lingers, not
the need. Lately I've been using =finder= a lot to do file-system stuff. Is it
time to integrate here? Not sure yet. =direx= [fn:85d63d39: https://github.com/m2ym/direx-el]
also seems nice.

Finally I ran into real scenario. This will sound kind of trivial, but it is
valuable: I had 5-10 directories that I wanted to work with. I wasn't sure
which ones I would want to inspect so I had to dig around. I ended up keeping
3-5 of them open at a time as I was comparing their contents. This really wasn't
suitable for any combination of any command-line or Emacs tools. It is exactly
what I would need a GUI to do, so now I am curious about if or how I would do
this inside of Emacs. Is =dired= an option here? No, not right now. OIC there
are so many options [fn:4c7d24d1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538064/nerdtree-for-emacs]! What about =eshell=?
That doesn't really suit the use case, either. Just watched this [fn:a34be4d5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtocCAWxiE]

Have mixed feelings about this. First, glad it is here, and a lot of packages do
use it. Eventually I'll need to set up a larger font. My desire was to have
=pos-tip= use the current theme values, but I couldn't figure out how and the

wearing watches long ago. That was a mistake. Put on a time piece and turn off
date and time status on the host OS and inside of Emacs. This source block
is kept for reference, and excluded from the generated configuration.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref ignore
(setq display-time-format "%R %y-%m-%d")
(display-time-mode +1)
#+end_src

When you load modes, most of them show up in the minibuffer. After you read
their name a few thousand times, you eventually quite forgetting that you
loaded them and need a diminished reminder. [fn:0a48462d: http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/diminish]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

Over time you start to, as which everything else in Emacs, think about
configuring it "better". Simple things like the file state indicator [fn:c6a0c2b8: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_mode_line.html]
is one of the first to jump out at you. In my case I've made some nice changes
via the built-in mechanisms. Powerline [fn:8090ede6: https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline] really got me thinking though
just because it is so stunning with the use of XPM [fn:7aca939e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap]. Reading through
it though, it would require some real digging in, and the documentation doesn't
say much and I wasn't sure that I wanted to pursue that much right now.
Simple mode line [fn:75606d43: https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/smart-mode-line/] says all the right things, I like their documentation
and am not sure whether or not it knows the right things to highlight, or not.
How does it know? Clearly there are many ideas [fn:d5ddabf6: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeLineConfiguration] on how to customize the
modeline. How may we be sure that they are doing it right and displaying
everything that mode expects them to possibly be displaying? Like most things
it is just trust, and verify. For now it is easier to stick with the built in,
and grow it organically. Perhaps more importantly, I /do/ like the built-in
modeline style.

Make deleting an entire line work how you may
expect [fn:f3160ceb: http://www.wilfred.me.uk/.emacs.d/init.html#sec-3-7]

*This section is entirely defined adhering to the philosophy defined above*.

Sometimes you want to temporarily bind keys. Haven't much of a need yet myself,
but when the time comes, this [fn:685d5985: https://github.com/abo-abo/centimacro]
looks like a great option to have.

Generally disallow stomping of global key-mappings unless it makes sense to me
(thank you Stefan Monnier for pointing out that referencing the map variable
is all it takes):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

These key-bindings are custom for me and I've been using them for so long, and
that makes it rig+1ht. There are always opportunities for improvement, though.
Recently it dawned on me that it is poor-form to waste 3 function keys on
the same task, so I rebound =F1= to different modifiers that I hope are
consistent, and free up space, too. My preference is to leave =F5=, =F6, and
=F7= generally unbound and available for similar operations that are performed
in most programming modes. For example, =F5= will execute code in any Lisp-like
environment.

**** NON-DISRUPTIVE

Save 3 bytes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "3." 'gcr/insert-ellipsis)
#+end_src

Indent with spaces for the likely scenario:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "4 " (lambda () (interactive) (insert "    ")))
#+end_src

German umlauts for a, o, and u:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global (concat "A" "{") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "ä")))
(key-chord-define-global (concat "A" "}") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "Ä")))

(key-chord-define-global (concat "U" "{") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "ü")))
(key-chord-define-global (concat "U" "}") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "Ü")))
#+end_src

Arrows, so many:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-,") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "←")))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-.") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "→")))
#+end_src

Nice for UML, and French?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "<<" (lambda () (interactive) (insert "«")))
(key-chord-define-global ">>" (lambda () (interactive) (insert "»")))
#+end_src

ace-jumping is frequent, too, and this one is perfect all home keys same,
dominant strong hand:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "jk" 'ace-jump-mode)
#+end_src

Using =ace-jump= will introduce a new idea to you of easily jumping around
within a buffer. From you, from wherever you jump /to/, you need jump /back/.
Make it really really easy to do so.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "m," 'ace-jump-mode-pop-mark)
#+end_src

Jumping to lines actually happens a lot. When you look at this layout, remember,
or rather consider, that what you jump to, or navigate to, is layered in the
sense that the granularity of your actions changes and all actions provided here
are helpful for those different situations. This used to be =kc-df= but I typed
=df= for data.frame so I had to change it, as well as the following which used to
be =cv=. That wasn't good either because it is a painful reach. I need to document
the lessons learned above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "fg" 'goto-line)
#+end_src

In the same spirit of poppping the mark with =ace-jump=, follow a similar appraoch
for =goto-line=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "vb" 'pop-to-mark-command)
#+end_src

Sometimes I want to jump to a line in the current buffer… sort of an ace-jump
but just for a line that I can see. This [fn:d007291a: https://github.com/coldnew/linum-relative] is the way to do it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'linum-relative)
(key-chord-define-global "dk" 'linum-relative-toggle)
#+end_src

ace-window is frequent, is beginning to adhere to a pattern of dual approaches:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "nm" 'ace-window)
#+end_src

Do nearly a =IKJL= style up/down/left/right arrow key, using using chords, saves a
trip.

You might wonder why I would use this when ace-jump-window is available? Good
question. Sometimes you know exactly what buffer you want, so jump to it, and
sometimes you just don't, and that is when you do it this way:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "JK" (lambda () (interactive) (other-window 1)))
(key-chord-define-global "KL" (lambda () (interactive) (next-buffer)))
(key-chord-define-global "L:" (lambda () (interactive) (previous-buffer)))
#+end_src

Web-searches occur quite frequently once you've a nice work-flow established.
The keys in that mode are:
- w :: word
- s :: symbol
- l :: line
- r :: region
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "ws" 'google-this-mode-submap)
#+end_src

These actions appear in order of importance, and thus frequency of use

Do the /right thing/ for getting to the start of the line!
#+begin_src emacs-lips
(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'beginning-of-line-dwim)
#+end_src

I use VC quite frequently. This is easy to reach, and does what must be done:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-;") 'vc-next-action)
#+end_src

Easily select regions:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-'") 'er/expand-region)
#+end_src

multiple cursor mode… I kept these together because until I make an image, it
would be too confusing to keep them in the non and slightly disruptive sections,
as they are clearly that:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-9") 'mc/edit-lines)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-0") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "M--") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-8") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
#+end_src

You don't moves lines or regions a ton, but when you do, you usually can't use
the arrow keys per mode, so use chords instead.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define-global "yu" 'move-text-up)
(key-chord-define-global "hj" 'move-text-down)
#+end_src

Surprisingly you swap lines enough to justify automating it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Speed

As of <2014-07-05 Sat>, there is, as one would expect, quite a focus on speeding
up Emacs. What is the definition of speeding it up? Well, that depends. Like any
UX designer knows, it is all subjective. Is a lazy-load to make startup feel
fast making it faster? It depends. What struck me is the trend for the last few
years to =autoload= basically everything in packages. That is a curious step
because I prefer =require= to make it obvious what we are doing. Either way,
speed matters and all of these topics got me wanting at least to know what is
going on with Emacs in terms of speed… by some measure.

Emacs Start Up Profiler (ESUP) [fn:cd3051f0: https://github.com/jschaf/esup]
does just what it says, and I use it here. For now I do not want to
record startup times becase I've got no question that I want to be answered yet.

Probably, I'm just a simple user and never run into this problem, or perhaps
my layout is so simple that restoring it is not a big deal. That said, I've

Add this [fn:de8dd6b1: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Resizing-Windows.html] to the list of things to maintain your sanity… how to re-size
windows. My bindings are in the key-bindings section.
*** Window Management

These hasn't exactly been a huge need for this. Recently =popwin= [fn:36388f6a: https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el]
got me interested because it handles a little annoyance that we all face.
Working with ℝ, got me a lot more curious about =emacs-window-manager= [fn:8659dad9: https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-window-manager].

** Primary usage

The purpose of this section is to put some visiblity on the modes, how they are
used, and where. After configuring a bunch of modes you may find that you want
global defaults, don't be afraid of making such changes (and reverting them
too).

*** Custom variables

*This must come before manually set variables*

This approach needs further research as it seems to work but I am not sure what
kind of trouble I could cause by doing this so I know that it may cause some
such trouble!

For example, sometimes values I set in here get stomped on. That is probably
because the call to =custom-set-variables= occurs /after/ the packages are loaded
specifying them. Right now I am still not totally sure because of
=eval-after-load= blocks.

**** Binary file editing [fn:c6365160: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Editing-Binary-Files.html] [fn:29c0b07f: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HexlMode]

Long ago it was quite common to edit binary files if not for adding lots of
cheats to games then to see CAFEBABE written in Java class files (if you can't
enjoy either of those things then you are too serious). Hexl mode comes built
into Emacs, and it is great to know that it is there.

**** Code folding [fn:76ed1f1f: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideShow] [fn:90bfa78a: http://gnufool.blogspot.com/2009/03/make-hideshow-behave-more-like-org-mode.html]

Code folding really isn't a hugely important function. You just use it once
in a while and you notice it when you don't have it. For years I used this [fn:c3cd65d8: http://emacs.wordpress.com/2007/01/16/quick-and-dirty-code-folding/]
and it is fine, but I figured I ought to stick with a more feature rich option,
just to give it a try. Here are some of the other options: [fn:425c5a43: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMode][fn:80e6214c: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FoldingMode][fn:160: https://github.com/zenozeng/yafolding.el][fn:82e77bec: http://cedet.sourceforge.net/].
If you know org-mode, then using that style of control makes it easier to use
then the built in bindings for hideshow [fn:30f9d745: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hideshow.html], on which hideshow-org is built. After using this for a while, it came not to be the right
thing for me. There is no mode hook. It failed when I wanted to bind it to
something other than =TAB=. So, using the built in hideshow turned out to be the
best option.

**** Command execution helper [fn:e2221a4d: https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex/]

When I call commands, I usually end up running the same commands over and over.
There are of course key-bindings to deal with this, and also command history. What
I really prefer though is just being able to type an abbreviation for the command
to access it, like =org-html-export-to-html= for example. Smex makes it happen.

**** Copyright [fn:da6ca112: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/autotype.html#Copyrights]

Copyright management includes only two problems: keeping the near up to date
and choosing the right one. The built in functions will insert a generic copyright
and also update the year, and that is pretty nice. It would be nice to have
something like this [fn:d8940b7a: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Headers.html] created, though. Even an OSS license chooser
would be nice [fn:c7c0ee54: http://choosealicense.com/], but I haven't found a nice option yet.

**** Pretty printing

This [fn:c2458ee6: https://github.com/steckerhalter/ipretty] library =ipretty= got
me interested in pretty-printing. Of course, I had forgotten that
=pp-eval-expression= is available and that it is already part of the distribution.

**** Expression Management [fn:60c9aa87: https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens]

There are a lot of nice options [fn:f3efaa48: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit] [fn:65635705: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair] [fn:3407e119: https://github.com/rejeep/wrap-region.el] [fn:143: https://code.google.com/p/emacs-textmate/] [fn:2c32e1ab: https://github.com/capitaomorte/autopair]. For the
longest time, =paredit= was all that I
used, but then I started using Emacs for everyone else besides Lisp and was kind
of stymied not having great expression management tools.  Smartparens seems to
have emerged as king, so here it sits. While I was setting up the new configuration I
set this up last… that was a major mistake. After using a good symbolic
expression management tool, you quickly forget the nightmare of having to keep
expressions balanced yourself. Sure we did fine with VI… but it is so nice to
have the tool do it for you. Remember what Olin Shivers said?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I object to doing things that computers can do.
#+END_QUOTE

You get a lot of niceties that you would expect like balanced brackets and
since there is a strict mode it acts just like Paredit. Additionally you may
wrap selections with pairs, auto-escape strings that occur within other strings,
and showing matching pairs (of any supported form). =sp-show-pair-from-inside=
is kind of interesting. How it works is that normally when your cursor is to the
right of a bracket, then the entire expression is highlighted. My assumption is
to make it easy for you to see the scope of the s-exp. When you move forward, to
the right of that opening bracket, then that highlight goes away. When you set
this flag to non-nil, you get a different behavior where just the bracket is
highlighted. Not sure how this would help, but still it is kind of interesting
to me because it keep your focus. My use case is that you find an s-exp that you
want to edit and start doing it, and in that case I wouldn't use this flag.
However, say you had wanted to edit and moved the cursor one char forward and
were interrupted. Perhaps you would this kind of highlight so when you come back
there is still some indicator. From a user-perspective, it just seemed
interesting.

**** File-system/directory management [fn:b2f9070d: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html]

The last file or file-system management tool that I used wast Norton Commander [fn:729276f2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander]
and then Midnight Commander [fn:1cf538c0: https://www.midnight-commander.org/], but my usage was pretty basic. Beyond
those basics, I can do even more, basic stuff, in =bash=. Lately I've wanted
something a little more consistent, powerful, and memorable, and that led me
here. Dired is a user-interface for working with your file-system; you select
files and directories and then choose what to do with them. The ability to
customize what you see is included out of the box, and there are additional
helper packages [fn:b1078e9e: http://www.emacswiki.org/DiredDetails], too.

You can use the usual machinery to work with the files. Highlight a region
and operation selections occur for all files in that region. Commands are
scheduled, and then executed, upon your command. Files can be viewed in modify
or read-only mode, too. There is an idea of =mark-in files, which is to select
them and perform operations on the marked files. There are helper methods for
most things you can think if like directories or modified-files or whatever,
meaning you can use regexen to mark whatever you like however you like. If that
suits you, then don't be afraid of using the regular expression builder [fn:7b0e8e3b: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html]
that is built into Emacs. Bulk marked file operations include additionally
copying, deleting, creating hard links to, renaming, modifying the mode,
owner, and group information, changing the time-stamp, listing the marked
files, compressing them, decrypting, verifying and signing, loading or byte
compiling them (Lisp files).

=g= updates the current buffer; =s= orders the listing by alpha or date-time.

=find-name-dired= beings the results back into Dired, which is nifty.

Wdired lets you modify files directly via the UI, which is interesting. Image-Dired
lets you do just that.

=+= creates a new directory. =dired-copy-filename-as-kill= stores the list of
files you have selected in the kill ring. =dired-compare-directories= lets you
perform all sorts of directory comparisons, a handy tool that you need once in
a while but definitely do need.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

After dabbling, something happened that really changed my mind. These three
articles changed everything: [fn:87e72370: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2014/04/10/dired-shell-commands-find-xargs-replacement/] [fn:d82e40f9: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/03/25/working-multiple-files-dired/] [fn:fe52afc4: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2013/10/10/wdired-editable-dired-buffers/].
They just made the power of Dired so obvious, and so easy to use, that it
instantly because delightful to use. That was very, very cool. Even though I
was really, really happy with Finder and Explorer… suddenly it just became so
obvious and pleasant to use Dired. That is so wild.

Key notes when executing shell commands on file selection…

Substitution:
- =<cmd> ?= :: 1* calls to cmd, each file a single argument
- =<cmd> *= :: 1 call to =cmd=, selected list as argument
- =<cmd> *""= :: have the shell expand the * as a globbing wild-card
  - Not sure what this means

Synchronicity:
- =<cmd> …= :: by default commands are called synchronously
- =<cmd> &= :: execute in parallel
- =<cmd> ;= :: execute sequentially, asynchronously
- =<cmd> ;&= :: execute in parallel, asynchronously

Key notes on working with files in multiple directories… use the following:

Use =find= just like you would at the command line and all of the results show
up in a single Dired buffer that you may work with just like you would any other
file appearing in a Dired buffer. The abstraction here becomes so obvious, you
may ask yourself why you never considered such a thing /before/ now (as I did):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'find-dired)
(setq find-ls-option '("-print0 | xargs -0 ls -ld" . "-ld"))
#+end_src

Noting that:
- =find-dired= :: is the general use case
- =find-name-dired= :: is for simple, single string cases

And if you want to use the faster Elisp version, that uses lisp regex, use:
- =find-lisp-find-dired= :: for anything
- =find-lisp-find-dired-subdirectories= :: for only directories

Key notes on working with editable buffers…

As the author notes, you probably already instinctually knew what is possible.
After reading his brief and concise exposition, it would be hard /not/ to
intuit what is possible! The options are big if you make a writable file buffer.
Think about using multiple cursors. Done? Well, that is a no-brainer. Once you
grok multiple cursors just =find-dired= what you need and then do what you need
to do to it. Very cool.

- =dired-toggle-read-only, C-x C-q= :: cycle between dired-mode and wdired-mode
- =wdired-finish-edit, C-c C-c= :: commit your changes
- =wdired-abort-changes, C-c ESC= :: revert your changes

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'wdired)
(setq wdired-allow-to-change-permissions t)
(setq wdired-allow-to-redirect-links t)
(setq wdired-use-interactive-rename +1)
(setq wdired-confirm-overwrite +1)
(setq wdired-use-dired-vertical-movement 'sometimes)
#+end_src

Today I just learned about =image-dired=, why didn't I think to ask before now?

When you selected a bunch of files or directories, you /may/ want to communicate
somewhere your selection somehow. The simplest way to do this is to utilize
=dired-copy-filename-as-kill=. What a nice idea, and its default binding is =w=.

Since I started using a menu bar again, and wanting to get Imenu really
exercised, Dired in Imenu seems like an obvious choice.

**** Games [fn:e3bacb4b: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Amusements.html#Amusements]

Sometimes you need a break, and you aren't a gamer any more, but that doesn't
mean you can't have fun. =life= and =doctor= alone will give you something
to ponder and practice not taking too seriously.

**** Intellisense (Auto Completion) [fn:a5ec7f2e: http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/]

Can you thrive and profit without auto-completion? Surely. The feature is kind
of a comfort blanket for most of us; you will never fail to build a system
without it (unless you are using Java, then you need IntelliJ). Still it is
quite nice to have popup documentation. Still wanting a nice documentation
popup, I think that yet again Purcell and friends make our lives easier.

Thus far, auto-complete has worked fine. More than a few blog-posts do mention
company-mode [fn:87ff338a: https://company-mode.github.io/], so I read up on it. It seems quite nice, but right now I
haven't got a reason to explore it further though.

Still having some mixed feelings about what engine to use to display the popups.
Popup itself is quite easy for me to read since it uses the same font as
everything else. That alone makes it perfect. Still, the idea of having real
popups is intriguing. Either way, both do work, so I will customize as needed.
Until I customize the pos-tip font to make it bigger, though, I will stick with
the old-fashioned style.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'fuzzy)
(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'auto-complete-config)
(setq ac-quick-help-prefer-pos-tip nil)
(ac-config-default)
(setq ac-auto-start nil)
(ac-set-trigger-key "TAB")
(gcr/diminish 'auto-complete-mode)
#+end_src

**** Location awareness

The idea of reporting to you the current logical location within in the current
file via information in the modeline [fn:6bad0c26: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Which-Function.html] sounds very interesting to me.
However, when I really think about it, I have no good answer to the question:
"If you didn't know how you got there, then how does it help to know that you
are where you are?". That holds true at least, when it comes to maintaining
files.

**** Project management [fn:7a558748: http://batsov.com/projectile/]

Not everyone likes projects, but I do. There is no perfect middle ground though,
that is until this library came along. It is such a joy to use. Somehow I forgot
how much I liked it because it is so easy to just use =ido-find-file= for
things. After reading a blog post, I revisited the difference between that and
=projectile-find-file=… well the latter has its place as it makes it much
simpler only to deal with files that are known to be project files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(projectile-global-mode 1)

#+end_src

**** Rectangle / Cursors [fn:8d7c694f: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rectangles.html] [fn:178: https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el]

Once in a very long while I have the need to modify rectangles. Only once in a
while because one may use the key recorder to do most of the same work. There
are a few options [fn:e9f56c39: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RectangleCommands], and that bothers me, so I didn't choose any of them.

Working here thought got me thinking about other folks perspectives, and I
ended up here [fn:9c0a4159: http://emacsrocks.com/e13.html]. This is a strangely intriguing feature. It is quite
versatile as long as you have got a mental model for things. The difference is
that if you are OK with key macros, imagine that multiple-cursors is kind of a
way to use keyboard macros while making it very visible and dynamic and
also using the cursor location along with that interactivity.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Remote file access [fn:4997f5f8: https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/]

TRAMP stands for "Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple Protocol". It is

**** Save history of all things [fn:43a849e2: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html] [fn:ac19c66e: http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/savehist.el] [fn:c39d161c: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1229142/how-can-i-save-my-mini-buffer-history-in-emacs]

It is nice to have commands and their history saved so that every time you
get back to work, you can just re-run stuff as you need it. It isn't a radical
feature, it is just part of a good user experience.

This file keeps track of everything that =savehist= stores for us and doesn't
need to be version controlled so it is checked as a real file.

The file that =savehist= stores its stuff in is not under version control.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst gcr/savehist-file-store "~/.emacs.d/savehist")
(defun gcr/warn-savehist-file-store ()
  "Warn of savehist misconfiguration."
  (interactive)
  (unless (gcr/file-exists-not-symlink gcr/savehist-file-store)
    (warn "Can't seem to find a savehist store file where it was expected at: %S. Savehist should continue to function normally; but your history may be lost."
          gcr/savehist-file-store)))
#+end_src

**** Searching / Finding [fn:350ccf16: http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/lisp/ido.el] [fn:137: https://github.com/lewang/flx]

There are many ways to easily find what you need, for a command, for a file,
and this mode seems to be a quite nice way. Something I had been curous about
but forgotten and stumbled upon again was vertical ido listing, and I added that
back to see how it goes. My initial reaction was that I had wanted this all
along, though the transition from looking left-right to top-down was a little
unsettling.

**** Selection style [fn:29f58393: https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el]

IntelliJ Idea is yet again to blame for being awesome; even the author of this
library suffers, or rather enjoys, this phenomenon. When you make a selection of
text you typically want to do it in a smart way, selecting the first logical
block, then expanding logically outwards, and so on. It could mean selecting a
variable, then its definition statement, and then the entire code block for
example. Before now I really never had many uses for the =C-u= universal
argument functionality for method calls, but if you pass in a negative value
before calling =er/expand-region= it will have the nice feature of reversing
its incremental selection.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'expand-region)
#+end_src

**** Spell-checking [fn:4fc20d0a: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Spelling.html] [fn:b6f544fd: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractiveSpell] [fn:e620b160: http://blog.binchen.org/posts/what-s-the-best-spell-check-set-up-in-emacs.html] [fn:8ce1e37a: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/ac-ispell]

There are two ways to spell-check:
run-at-a-time or interactive. Both delegate the actual checking to aspell,
ispell, and hunspell. Both styles are quite nice options, and flyspell will
even integrated with compilers to help report those kinds of errors to you, too,
but my personal preference for now is run-at-a-time. The taxpayers didn't pay so
much to make flyspell have to do all the hard work for me. aspell is there
most UNI*, running =ispell= from Emacs just does the right thing.

Even after reading this later, I agree with it despite the fact that I
constantly wax and wane between wanting to use it and finding something
/better/ despite having no criteria by which to truly judge in the first place.

The =aspell= directionary is version controlled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst gcr/aspell-dict "~/.aspell.en.pws")
(defun gcr/warn-aspell-dict ()
  "Warn of aspell misconfiguration."
  (interactive)

    (warn
     "Can't seem to find an aspell dictionary where it was expected at: %S. aspell should continue to function normally; but your personal dictionary will not be used."
     gcr/aspell-dict)))
(gcr/warn-aspell-dict)
#+end_src

**** Syntax checking

It is a great feature. Flyspell never interested me though because of so many
negative reports and it just didn't seem that important. Well, that was before
breaking this document for the N^{th} time! There is a need, and Flycheck [fn:88ce9bae: https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck]
seems to be the best of the best out there.

**** Templating [fn:c3b8f741: https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet]

Code completion is nice to have; but the second you install it and learn how to
use it, you will never find the need to again. Accept it and move on.

=yas= snippets directory is not version controlled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'yasnippet)
(defconst gcr/yas-snippet-dir (concat (cask-dependency-path gcr/cask-bundle 'yasnippet)
                               "/snippets"))
(defun gcr/warn-yas-snippet-dir ()
  "Warn of Yas misconfiguration."
  (interactive)
  (unless (f-directory? gcr/yas-snippet-dir)
    (warn
     "Can't seem to find the Yas snippet dir where it was expected at: %S. Yas should continue function but without its standard snippets loaded."

**** Very large files

Emacs will warn you if you open "large files" into a buffer. Thankfully, I have
never had such an issue. However, surely I will have the need at some point in
the future, and when I do I will look at vlfi [fn:eaea2bc3: https://github.com/m00natic/vlfi]

When I set about on this project, I had ideas about how this document would
look. The decent ideas worked out well. The good ideas were bad, and the
unexpected ideas were delightful. I had though that a this section would be
very graphical, but the more I work on it, the simpler it seems to be when you
split it up in the respective sections. Originally I had wanted to use org
tables for nearly everything, but now I question that desire (thought it is a
great feature). The mistake that I made was not new to me and is suffered by all
macro writers… the solution instead of waiting for experience and
extracting it from there. As it turns out, I am human.

Anything that should always happen goes here.

In the last setup, I went back and forth about where to do a and of line
white-space cleanup, if at all. The con is that with real-mode-autosave enabled,
when you are typing your cursor keeps jumping, and that is not nice. An idle
timer to do cleanup wouldn't be any different, because I really want saves to
constantly be occurring. My final decision is to just call =whitespace-cleanup=
as needed rather than tracking down or writing some code to do it myself.

=fancy-narrow-to-region= [fn:c48bcc89: https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/fancy-narrow] is a nice to have. Their approach is kind of
worth noting, simply in that =;;;###autoload= commands are utilized so that
the library is not required to be specified for use. Is this convenience without
downside or just a bad idea from a support perspective? Unknown, at least for
now. I'll err on the side of explicitness (when I'm paying attention at least).

Auto-completion for .-separated words [fn:ab4081de: https://github.com/tkf/auto-complete-chunk] seems like a good idea, so I will
put it here and not worry too much about what header this lives in. The source
explains how to use this feature… it must be specified what is allowed per-mode
- which makes sense.

course a mode for it, with a hook/

***** C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) [fn:d383cc00: http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/]

CLIPS is a very special thing. OSS, expertly developed and used. Truly a hidden
gem among the muck. =clips-mode= [fn:36f704bf: https://github.com/grettke/clips-mode]
has had a long life behind it, and only some time ago the folks at MELPA helped
me to get it in there as the original maintainers were not to be found nor did
the folks at that university reply to emails about licensing and lineage.

=eval-expression= gets really, really handy once you get into the Emacs
lifecycle. My goal was to enable =smartparens= in the minibuffer, and it didn't
work. I posted a question on it, and Drew Adams drew.adams@oracle.com explained
how =icicle= provides a better version of =eval-expression=, and how in lieu of
that, =pp-eval-expression= is even better. Michael Heerdegen shared his solution [fn:321475a6: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-07/msg00135.html] for a rich modeline evaluator.

***** Email

My approach for managing email for years and years was to use MUTT [fn:2e04cf54: http://www.mutt.org/]
at school and I didn't care about archiving it. Then I tried Hotmail and it was
fine. Then I heard Gmail was better so I switched to that. Gmail is where I
started to take email a little more seriously, but not too seriously. It was the
mail lists that got me interested in email.

My current workflow with Gmail is really nice, I like it a lot. Needless to say
though the more you use Emacs the more you just want to do everything inside of
it. After specifically avoiding the pursuit of using Emacs for email, I finally
caved a tiny bit after hearing so many pleasant stories of org-mode users who
use GNUS [fn:ab3b7bca: http://www.gnus.org/].

It seems that setting up GNUS to work with Gmail [fn:e33cecef: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail]
is quite straight-forward. Specifically, it looks like GNUS can handle Gmail's
use of /tags/, which I use for a *lot* and do not want to lose them.

Tha is where I have left it for now. Since I keep revisiting the topic though, I
needed to capture thoughts and feelings on it here to get it off my mind.

For a minimalist release history, read the news file [fn:7be08525: http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/news.html].

For a brief, brief overview and release history, read the readme [fn:1b644ec0: http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html].

For a comprehensive overview, read the manual [fn:adfd9a4c: http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html].

In it:
- =S= refers to any language in the family.
  - ℝ is what I'm interested in.
- First 2.5 pages do some nice expectation-setting.
- Generally seems like a highly rich development environment with support for
  editing, debugging, and support with everything that you would expect from
  the best of Emacs.
- Manual covers most requested variables for configuring, but the customize
  facility covers more, and mentions that either way you should avoid doing so
  until you have used =ESS= for a while.
- Check that =ess= is installed with a call to =ess-version=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst gcr/ess-version "14.09")

(defun gcr/warn-ess-version ()
  "Warn of ess misconfiguration."
  (interactive)
  (when (not (version= ess-version gcr/ess-version))
    (warn "Insufficient ess-mode requirements. Expected %S. Found: %S " gcr/ess-version ess-version)))
(gcr/warn-ess-version)
#+end_src

ℝ first notes:
- ℝ will start ℝ via =Emacs=
- Multiple =ESS= processes may run simultaneously, and may be selected by a
  specific language via their buffer name that has a number appended, or may be
  accessed via a menu using =ess-request-a-process=.
- =ESS= works transparently on remote machines using =TRAMP= to manage a remote
  ℝ instance. An example is provided for Amazon. Means exist for supporting remote
  graphical displays or redirecting to a file. Excellent support seems to exist
  to quite flexibly support unexpected things like starting an =ESS= supported
  program in a plain old shell and being able to convert it to an =ESS= supported
  buffer.

Various user interaction stuff:
- Return sends the input from wherever you hit return, nice.
- =M-{= and =M-}= cycle through commands you ran
- =M-h= select a whole "paragraph", a block in their terms
- =C-x [= moves through the previous ESS sessions, =C-x ]= forward.
- =C-c C-p= and =C-c C-n= cycle through previous commands.
  - How is this differet than the other one?
- =C-c RET= copies an old command to the prompt without running it
  - Great idea
- Keep your session transcript pruned
  - =ess-transcript-clean-region= removes non-commands from a transcript for you
- Previous command look-up can be done by completion via =comint-*-matching=.
  - =M-p= and =M-n= seem to work just fine though.
- Previous command execution, by name, offset, or just the last one, are by =!=
  - This feature is actually quite rich and a real regexen style system.

Always show eldoc for ℝ stuff, everywhere it may.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol t)
#+end_src

Various session interaction stuff
- Show objects in the work-space: =C-c C-x=
- Search for what libraries are available to the work-space: =C-c C-s=
- Load file with source: =C-c C-l=
- Visit errors: =C-c '= and =C-x '=
- Show help on an object: =C-c C-v=
- Quit: =C-c C-q=
- Abort: =C-c C-c=
- Switch between the console and the most recent file buffer: =C-c C-z=

Sending code to the ESS process
- =ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step=: Eval the region, or the line, move to next
  line
- =C-M-x=: Eval the current region, function, or paragraph
- =C-c C-c=: Do that and then go to the next line
- =C-c C-j=: Eval the current line
- =C-c M-j=: Eval line and jump to the console
- =C-c C-f=: Eval the currently selected function
- =C-c M-f=: Eval the currently selected function and jump to the console
- =C-c C-r=: Eval the region
- =C-c M-r=: Eval the region and jump to the console
- =C-c C-b=: Eval the buffer
- =C-c M-b=: Eval the buffer and jump to the console
- You can do all this stuff from transcript files, too.
  - My thought is that I never, ever will and if I do need to, I'm looking up the
    commands again as I don't want to make a habit of doing that kind of
    thing (running old transcripts).

Editing objects and functions:
- =C-c C-e C-d=: Edit the current object
- =C-c C-l=: Load source file into the ESS process
- =TAB= Indents/re-formats or completes code.
- =M-;=: Correctly indents the current comment

Help mode inside of ESS:
- =C-c C-v=: =ess-display-help-on-object=: Get help on anything
- =?=: Show commands available in help mode
- =h=: Show help for a different object. Currently focused object defaults.
- =n= and =p=: Cycle through sections
- =l=: Eval the current line in the console; usually sample code.
- =r=: Eval current region, too
- =q=: Quit out of that buffer
- =k=: Kill that buffer
- =x=: Kill that buffer and return to ESS
- =i=: Get info on a package
- =v=: Show vignettes
- =w=: Show current help page in browser

Completion:
- =TAB=: Complete anything
- =M-?=: Show completions available
- =ess-resynch=: Refreshes the completion cache

As of <2014-01-31 Fri>, you need to manually load ESS when you pull it from
MELPA [fn:8dece4ca: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2014-January/009705.html]. That is totally fine with me, that is really the best way to load stuff.
Out of curiosity, I read more about it here [fn:c5cac42b: https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/issues/6], but that occurred before
this previous post made by the maintainers. Even the source code in
=ess-autoloads.el= has a license from 2012, which is before the aforementioned
post. As such, this configuration step seems correct and necessary for now.
Additionally, this how the user manual expects a typical manual setup to be
configured.

Looked a tiny bit at how R hackers are formatting their code [fn:9039b33e: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml] [fn:da0df786: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html].
The simple (dumb) part of me suspects that C++ formatting is generally just fine [fn:5b466d0c: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7502540/make-emacs-ess-follow-r-style-guide].

There is strangely nice discussion about where temp files may be stored;
specifically for cases where you edit identically-named objects and want to keep
them in the same directory but per-project. That is not the need now, and it is
nice to know that it is an option.

Store history files and dump files in a single known location. If that location

but Vitalie Spinu mentioned them as being useful:
- =comint-previous-matching-input-from-input=
- =comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp=

Personal customizations for this mode. For some currently unknown reason,
=smartparens= only runs when you call =smartparens-strict-mode= and not
=turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode= like it does everywhere else.

For a while I used =ess-eval-buffer-and-go=, but now I know that it is insanely
faster to use =ess-eval-buffer= instead. Previously I've read people saying that,
and it is true.

This [fn:1ffa40c2: http://www.r-bloggers.com/a-small-customization-of-ess/]
post shares a nice setup for the assignment key; primarily if
you use underscores in your variable names, which I do on occasions. After
coding like this for just 10 short minutes it drove me nuts and that is totally
counter intuitive to me; I never would have expected that having to type two
characters to do an assignment would give me nuts. Anyway, the default behavior
is just fine; hit underscore twice gives you an underscore, and one gives you an
assignment!

*Philosophy*

The current =ESS= maintainers philosophies about how to maintain an ℝ code-base
make sense to me and are virtually the same as my own. Quite simply, the rule is
that the code artifacts are the single source of system definition. Consequently,
the system should be configured in this manner:

We want to keep dump files after loading them; never delete them. The idea
is that if we use them, then they are a valid part of the system definition and
need to be kept.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ess-keep-dump-files +1)
#+end_src

=ESS= allows us to quite easily modify live =S= objects and functions. It provides
this functionality via =ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer=. These changes are
considered to be experimental, and not part of the master record according to
our philosophy. As such, we don't care to know that these new versions ever
existed and their record will be forgotten from history. In other words, that
new, modified version of the object or function, is never saved to a file for
later reuse.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ess-delete-dump-files nil)
#+end_src

Since our systems are entirely file-based, the entirety of the system most
likely lives in different files. Before loading any file for sourcing, save
any ESS source buffers. This approach is in addition to two other things:
(1) Emacs is auto-saving every file buffer quite frequently and (2) there is
advice before every manual =eval= call so that the buffers and their files stay
in sync. Yes, it is really that important.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ess-mode-silently-save +1)
#+end_src

During the experimental mode of system development, you are likely to hack on
things using an ESS buffer associated with a file. Things can happen quite
unexpectedly, and it is easier to know that the code that you have =eval='d is
the value that is actually currently saved on-disk. You get it by now, that is
my personal preference. It is just a lot easier IMHO to know that your files are
persisted and my be stored in your VCS and that things "look are right".

Don't save the workspace when you quit ℝ and don't restore *ANYTHING* when you

Indent curly brackets correctly:

=smartparens= is serving me well. In this mode it is for curly, round, and square brackets. =ESS= handles indenting mostly right, too. One thing was unpleasant, though. When you define a new function, hitting return brings the curely bracket down to the newline but doesn't give it an empty line and indent the cursor one indentation over so that you may begin implementing the function. That is a big hassle; 4 unnecessary keystroke, it is really distracting and takes you out of the flow. It is such a little thing yet it is so powerfully distracting. It is like a mosquito in your tent! Searching for a solution revealed that I am not alone here.

This post [fn:32fe93bc: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ESSAutoParens] handles brackets,
indentation quite well [fn:5f2adfb8: http://emacs.1067599.n5.nabble.com/indentation-not-working-if-parentheses-are-already-closed-td283806.html] but doesn't provide the behavior that I want.
This post [fn:47104806: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18420933/enabling-mode-specific-paren-indentation-in-emacs-prelude] captured exactly what I was facing, yet didn't end with a
solution which was kind of shocking. Searching some more I ended up here [fn:cd67477f: https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/80], and this seems like the
ideal solution by the author of smartparens himself. This is probably a common thing
 as I found another post
with exactly my situation referencing that aforementioned solution, too [fn:2c7c401d: https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/issues/374]. This is a nice generalizable
approach that should serve me well for just about everything in this solution-area. Here [fn:5a732a42:: https://github.com/rdallasgray/graphene/blob/master/graphene-smartparens-config.el] is a post
showing a more advanced usage that handles context which is nice to know is an option.

=ESS= executes code in another process. That is no secret. When displaying output
from that code running in another process though, it can look like Emacs is
locking up. That is not the case [fn:2fbb65bd: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770523/how-can-i-background-the-r-process-in-ess-emacs].
What is happening that Emacs is waiting for the output. Configure this mode to
continue to accept user input, which is obviously critical, but don't wait for
the process to provide its output. Instead, all output is printed after the last
input lines. What we gain is perceived speed, and what we lose is the nice
sequential this/that/this/that we get from a typical REPL interaction. As I
write this, I'm not totally sure how this will work, but the documentation and
post are consistent and describe what I had wanted here so I will give it a try
and see how it goes.

- When you install packages, R needs to know which repository it should use. If
  you don't tell it, then it will ask you every time. It is just doing its job.
  Make it easier for yourself and specify a repo for once and for all.
  - Via [fn:41269bb7: http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages/]
  - Built-in docs explain that =local= should be used here
  - This could also be a one-liner: ~options("repos" = c(CRAN = "http://cran.r-project.org/"))~
#+begin_src R
local({
    r = getOption("repos")
    r["CRAN"] = "http://cran.r-project.org/"
    options(repos = r)
})
#+end_src

- By default, hitting enter in the =browser= will submit a =c= for "continue
  execution at the next statement"
  - It is too easy to hit enter when you didn't mean it
  - It just /feels/ imprecise
  - Never let this happen, disable that feature
#+begin_src R
options(browserNLdisabled = TRUE)
#+end_src

Show timestamps to 3 sub-seconds:
#+begin_src R
options("digits.secs"=3)
#+end_src

Make the ℝ prompt stand out (be sure to tell ESS how to handle this):
#+begin_src R
options(prompt="ℝ> ")
#+end_src

Do not allow automatic coercion of strings into factors, as you can specify this
by argument to make it /real/ obvious. Looks like the best way is to leave it
alone globally and always do it by hand though. hwickam commented that it is
bad, bad idea to make this option global not because of your code, but because
of everyone else's that you are using which relies on the option being set to
=TRUE=.
#+begin_src R
options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
#+end_src

This might be /too much/, but always show a call stack when *any* warnings or
errors occur
#+begin_src R
options(showWarnCalls=TRUE)
options(showErrorCalls=TRUE)
#+end_src

Be highly conservative about errors and warnings: handle the former immediately
and cause the latter to be errors. However, only do this after your workspace
has initialized correctly. Do so too soon and most things won't work because
this approach is only to handle /my/ issues. Imagine of the whole work just
handled their own issues! Anway, the safe values are set here, leave them alone.
Making them more aggressive will break your startup. When you are ready to set
things to be more aggressive, turn it on yourself
#+begin_src R
options(error=NULL)
options(warn=0)
#+end_src

Don't print more than 500 lines. If you can grok more than 500 lines then please
teach me. Be at ease, there is a helper to remove that restriction, just in case.
#+begin_src R
options(max.print=500)
#+end_src

Partial matching is a neat and flexible feature for objects. In theory, it is
quite powerful and convenient. In practice it seems like a really bad idea to
me. It is a /personal preference/. It only makes sense from that perspective.
This could bork 3rd party code.
#+begin_src R
options(warnPartialMatchDollar = TRUE)
#+end_src

Locale:
- Make sure that the language is set correctly. I couldn't find anything specific
  about setting it this way other than various posts. In practice you would really
  put all of this in your system environment configuration, but I'm wanting to be
  a little more particular here because it affects operations on data structures,
  in particular sorting.
- Error messages are mostly useful when they are displayed in English, so make
  sure that the locale is always English [fn:24499ef7:    http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Localization-of-messages].
  "Note that the LANGUAGE environment variable has precedence over ~LC_MESSAGES~ in
  selecting the language for message translation on most R platforms." [fn:51fe4215: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/locales.html]
- Note:
  - My previous approach was to define a top level binding for the locale string
    and pass that reference to bind each of the following settings. That was fine
    until I wanted to be able to easily clear out all of the top-level bindngs to
    "reset" it with a =rm(ls())= kind of thing. For that reason, I just use the
    manifest strings here.
#+begin_src R

      - SQLite creates an in-memory database!
  - Details
    - The typical action of sqldf is to
    - create a database :: in memory
    - read in the data frames and files :: used in the select statement. This is
      done by scanning the select statement to see which words in the select
      statement are of class "data.frame" or "file" in the parent frame, or the
      specified environment if envir is used, and for each object found by
      reading it into the database if it is a data frame. Note that this
      heuristic usually reads in the wanted data frames and files but on
      occasion may harmlessly reads in extra ones too.
    - run the select statement :: getting the result as a data frame
    - assign the classes :: of the returned data frame’s columns if
      method = "auto". This is done by checking all the column names in the
      read-in data frames and if any are the same as a column output from the
      data base then that column is coerced to the class of the column whose
      name matched. If the class of the column is "factor" or "ordered" or if
      the column is not matched then the column is returned as is. If
      method = "auto.factor" then processing is similar except that "factor"
      and "ordered" classes and their levels will be assigned as well. The
      "auto.factor" heuristic is less reliable than the "auto" heuristic. If
      method = "raw" then the classes are returned as is from the database.
    - cleanup :: If the database was created by sqldf then it is deleted;
      otherwise, all tables that were created are dropped in order to leave the
      database in the same state that it was before. The database connection is
      terminated.
    - Warning :: Although sqldf is usually used with on-the-fly databases which
      it automatically sets up and destroys if you wish to use it with existing
      databases be sure to back up your database prior to using it since
      incorrect operation could destroy the entire database.
  - Value
    - The result of the specified select statement is output as a data frame.
    - If a vector of sql statements is given as x then the result of the last
      one is returned.
    - If the x and connection arguments are missing then it returns a new
      connection and also places this connection in the option sqldf.connection.
      - Great to know that the connection is cached!
  - Notes
    - Big FYI: Commas in columns will be parsed as column separators!
      - Recommends using =read.table= if this matter
  - Examples
    - They all demonstrate how to do it in R and then again with SQL
    - Super helpful
    - You seem to be able to do everything that you would expect possible
  - Thoughts
    - Need to grok both R and SQL to use this safely
    - Using temp tables is kind of huge

      - Use =_= instead lf =.= in column names from a R call
        - Where is this in the documentation?

Notes from the official site [fn:078aba0c: https://code.google.com/p/sqldf/]
- Opening
  - How it works
    - The user simply specifies an SQL statement
    - in R using data frame names in place of table names
    - and a database with appropriate table layouts/schema is automatically
      created,
    - the data frames are automatically loaded into the database,
    - the specified SQL statement is performed,
    - the result is read back into R
    - and the database is deleted all automatically behind the scenes making the
      database's existence transparent to the user who only specifies the SQL
      statement.
  - Supports
    - SQLite
    - H2
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL
  - The FAQ mostly talks about SQLite
- Overview
  - with sqldf the user is freed from having to do the following, all of which
    are automatically done:
    - database setup
    - writing the create table statement which defines each table
    - importing and exporting to and from the database
    - coercing of the returned columns to the appropriate class in common cases
  - It an be used for
    - learning R if you know SQL
    - Doing it faster than R
    - Load portions of a really large file
- Troubleshooting
  - Set the driver expicitly
  - "error messages regarding a data frame that has a dot in its name. The dot
    is an SQL operator. Either quote the name appropriately or change the name
    of the data frame to one without a dot."
- FAQ
  - Column class conversion touched upon
  - Dots in names
    - Dots are SQL operators so can't use them
      - See =?SQL92Keywords=
    - For columns
      - Either use underscore
      - Or simply remove them
    - For tables
      - Double quote the name
  - H2 supports date types, which seems quite helpful
  - Name a column ending with two underscores and a type and the library will
    convert the type to R correctly
    - Mentioned in the docs
  - SQL is case *insensitive*
    - Don't rely on casing to differentiate column names
  - We may examine the in-memory database table structure
  - Be quite careful about CSV data that contains commas again as this lib
    won't handle it
  - Good examples of cleaning data gettig int into a R friendly format
  - Be sure to specify numeric values as integers or doubles so you get expected
    results from division
- Examples
  - Example 1. Ordering and Limiting

#+begin_quote
The aim of devtools is to make your life as a package developer easier by providing R functions that simplify many common tasks. R packages are actually really simple, and with the right tools it should be easier to use the package structure than not. Package development in R can feel intimidating, but devtools does every thing it can to make it as welcoming as possible. devtools comes with a small guarantee: if because of a bug in devtools a member of R-core gets angry with you, I will send you a handwritten apology note. Just forward me the email and your address, and I'll get a card in the mail.

plyr: Tools for splitting, applying and combining data in R

#+begin_quote
[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html][plyr]] is a set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each pieces and then put all the pieces back together. For example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development of plyr has been generously supported by BD (Becton Dickinson).

Watched [[https://www.screenr.com/qcv8][the video]]. Very nice to see; comfortable and familiar. Need to set up
RStudio for it. Clearly a critical tool. Cites Knuth.

Features are amazingly understated. If you've worked with all of these tools,
you will appreciate the importance of the author's effort!

=Objects=, =Options=, =Hooks=, and =Patterns= … what is this, Emacs?

There are demo [[http://yihui.name/knitr/demos][links]]. There is a [[https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples][project for examples]]. This [[http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/showcase/][showcase]] has links
to websites, book reviews, solutions, R packages, courses, workshops and
presentations, books, papers and reports, wrappers, and blog posts on =knitr=.

[[https://github.com/yihui/knitr][Here]] is the GitHub project. Read the motivations and see the hours and days and
weeks that you have had spared! Uses =testit=, so read up on that and added it.

Read the [[https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/FAQ.md][Frequently Asked Questions]]. Joined the [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knitr][mailing list]]. =ess= supports it.
Sure that I can configure the custom prompt. Great =README=.

[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html][CRAN]] as expected. Much better summary eg HTML, Makrdown, reStructuredText, and
AsciiDoc are mentioned. Curious about the cacheing, and how I would do it in
=org=. Custom code to run before and after a hunk are another thoughtful touch one
would expect coming from =org=. Also support Python and shell. The LaTeX and LyX
support is also pretty neat. Same [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/README.html][READM]]E. [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/knitr.pdf][Reference]].

- =attach= is a powerfuly convenient function. Sure, it can make you and your

  aside, it has its place, so it should not go away completely. However, it ought
  not be used much, and if you do need to use it, the it should be really really
  obvious.
  - Eg: [fn:7ce54638: http://www.r-bloggers.com/to-attach-or-not-attach-that-is-the-question/]

gcr$erroronwarnoff <- function() {

If you've never learned bash or Korn or c-shell, then you are missing out on
having some good fun… I mean work, getting work done. That said, I'm a baby when
it comes to really using them. It seemed like a good idea to learn some of them
well, and one that works seamlessly with Emacs seems like a great idea. Since it
is just another Elisp program, it has access to the same scope as everything else
running inside Emacs. The resources on this tool are a bit varied and all
valuable so I included all of them. The big takeaway is that you've got a
"normal" looking shell interface whose commands work transparently with
Elisp commands… and that can bey very pleasant.

Command completion is available.
Commands input in eshell are delegated in order to an alias, a built in command,
an Elisp function with the same name, and finally to a system call. Semicolons
desperate commands. =which= tells you what implementation will satisfy the call
that you are going to make. The flag =eshell-prefer-lisp-functions= does what it
says. =$$= is the result of the last command. Aliases live in
=eshell-aliases-file=. History is maintained and expandable. =eshell-source-file=
will run scripts. Since Eshell is not a terminal emulator, you need to tell it
about any commands that need to run using a terminal emulator, like anything using
curses by adding it to to =eshell-visual-commands=.

=my-eval-expression= makes that task pretty pleasant. The =*scratch*= buffer is
also really nice, too. =eval-last-sexp= obviously is a great option, too.
Sometimes, though, you want a REPL. Typically it is because you want to play
with stuff or have a record of the results that doesn't involve using
=eval-print-last-sexp=. Because I have the utility buffer set up in here, it
makes it quite unobtrusive and pleasant to use =ielm=.

My setup here tries to re-use as much as possible for the standard =lispy= mode
setup. That means I use my return handler, so when you want to evalute code in
here use =ielm-send-input= instead.

This [fn:aee1d8fd: http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/11/29/evaluating-elisp-emacs/]
is a *must-read* article.

Joseph G. Gay explained that what makes IELM so powerful is that you may execute
commands /within/ the scope of a different buffer. Using =ielm-change-working-buffer=
changes the current working buffer to something else.

That character is "MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL E".

Make it real easy to utilize the things that imenu provides, but make it keyboard

This is a little bit different than =idomenu= [fn:78d70829: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/idomenu] which is also very nice. The difference
between them is that the latter collects tags across all open buffers of the

(setq imenu-sort-function 'imenu--sort-by-name)
#+end_src

It was pretty clear even before trying it out that =imenu+= was a good idea [fn:b6404e93: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/imenu%2b.el].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'imenu+)
#+end_src

I had originally set up Imenu my making request to add its menu in every mode
hook so I had it appearing in a bunch of places. That worked fine until the
first time I tried tangling a file… which didn't work. The error message was
kind of revealing =The mode `' does not support Imenu= which was interesting
because I had recently added =imenu= before which tangling worked fine.
Testing it out with my simple org init file by removing the Imenu calls revealed
the problem. What cause the problem, I'm still not sure, but the solution is
only to use Imenu to modes that support it via =font-lock-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** Info [fn:c9bf4a1e: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InfoMode]

Once you accept Emacs and learn to enjoy Info files you may want to be able to
navigate them quickly, even if you haven't read the user manual as I have not.
ace-link [fn:4023603c: https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link] is really a nice way to do that.

For a while I used MIRC [fn:29fd53d0: http://www.mirc.com/], and then Irssi [fn:43d158f0: http://www.irssi.org/] and both are very
nice. Since I hang around in Emacs all day though, I figured I ought to
take a look at ERC. The documentation is highly modular, reflecting how the
application itself is implemented. Patience may be required, but the reward
for it is brilliant.

The main configuration is quite straightforward, with many ways to do it.

The IRC credentials file is not version controlled.

******** Libraries

********* Generally nice

- Dash / Dash-Functional

Not totally sure where this belongs, but dash [fn:9d300103: https://github.com/magnars/dash.el] is something that a lot
of the packages I use require, and it is an excellent library, so it needs
recognition in this document, and the Cask file, too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load "dash" '(dash-enable-font-lock))
#+end_src

- f [fn:dc91c0cb: https://github.com/rejeep/f.el]

Use the API to indicte things /to the reader/:
- =f-exists?= vs. =f-symlink?=

Because *I* can't seem to remember this critical and key detail on how files
work, here is an example. It says:
- Every symlink is a file
- Every file is not a symlink

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq a-tmp-file (make-temp-file "~/"))
(setq a-tmp-link (concat a-tmp-file "-LINK"))
(make-symbolic-link a-tmp-file a-tmp-link 'overwrite)

(print (setq no-file "/infinity"))
(print (f-exists? no-file))

(print a-tmp-file)
(print (f-exists? a-tmp-file))
(print (f-file? a-tmp-file))
(print (f-symlink? a-tmp-file))

(print a-tmp-link)
(print (f-exists? a-tmp-link))
(print (f-file? a-tmp-link))

#+end_src

#+end_example

- s [fn:017b522b: https://github.com/magnars/s.el]

Starting to think that I might want a "useful library" section, because I just
added the =xml-rpc= [fn:0c0b84fd: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/xml-rpc] library here because it is clearly useful:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'xml-rpc)
#+end_src

metaweblog is necessary for org2blog, too:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'metaweblog)
#+end_src

- Various
  - =uuid=
    - Make it easy to get some. Somes you really need them!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'uuid)
#+end_src
********* Built-in

pcase [fn:e76be200: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PatternMatching] provides pattern-matching macros. This is very nice whether
you've already used something like this before, or not!

********* Characters / Unicode

unidecode [fn:2a08dd99: https://github.com/sindikat/unidecode] does its best to
convert UTF-8 to ASCII; then I found that it wouldn't load so I removed it.

If you've verused a character terminal then you already know that
figlet [fn:81c97c99: http://www.figlet.org/] is a mandatory tool.
This [fn:08208a82: https://bitbucket.org/jpkotta/figlet] package makes it nice
to use. It has all the stuff you /would/ want to do, like figletify stuff.
It even has a little helper function to show you how the fonts look… beccause
you /know/ that you would have ended up writing something like that yourself if
it wreren't here:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'figlet)
#+end_src

Make sure =figlet= may be found on OSX via Brew.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

***** Javascript [fn:152bafed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript] [fn:42427fc4: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaScriptMode]

=auto-complete= often needs a symlink from =javascript-mode= to =js-mode= added.
That link is not version controlled, nor is it created via the API as it makes
the check simpler.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/js-mode-hook ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
  (setq js-indent-level 2)

    (unless (f-exists? js-mode-f)
      (warn
       "Can't seem to find the auto-complete library where it was expected at: %S. You might fix it with: ln -s %s/dict/javascript-mode %s" ac-dir ac-dir js-mode-f))))

***** LilyPond [fn:6d06e6b9: http://lilypond.org/]

All of my experience with musical notation is through GuitarPro [fn:3945829a: http://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php?pg=accueil-2&utm_expid=13369301-5.jyDTwdKfQ_CCdEqtpCIynQ.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F]
and even there I'm a baby user. Despite that, I've been curious about
music theory for a long time and this seems like a good way to take a dip.
At first, it didn't seem to work. then I "rebooted" and it seemed to
work, but not in org HTML export. This will require further research.

***** Lispy

A lot of people have downloaded =rainbow-delimiters=, 25377 as of <2014-07-26 Sat>.
The documentation is nice. =solarized= has support for it. The documentation says
something very specific:

#+begin_quote
The default colors are intentionally subtle; they are unobtrusive enough to make the mode worth looking at even if you usually don’t like rainbow parentheses modes.
#+end_quote

Well, that is me, so I am going to install it too.

***** Markdown [fn:e43df485: http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/]

I used to think that since org-mode exports to just about everything, that my
Markdown usage will be mostly limited to working with files on Github so I
turned on Github Flavored Markdown [fn:0b358cc2: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown] mode for README.md
files that are likely to appear on Github. That is fine and it doesn't interfere
with normal Markdown and also I'm getting more interested in Pandoc so it is
nice to have normal Markdown available easily here. GFM seems is in the release
now.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** Pandoc [fn:d8e34067: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/]

Heard good things about =pandoc-mode= [fn:0cacccd8: https://github.com/joostkremers/pandoc-mode] and I am really looking forward to
finding where dharma leads me with this. The mode documentation is here [fn:592907bc: https://joostkremers.github.io/pandoc-mode/].

***** Polymode [fn:918c4a07: https://github.com/vitoshka/polymode]

#+begin_quote
Object oriented framework for multiple emacs modes based on indirect buffers
#+end_quote

The status quo for LP with ℝ is =knitr= and my goal is to get first-class support
here. Started by reading the home page, I started
initial setup and a TODO. The literature on the page is seemingly directed more
at someone developing new modes. That seems pretty useful from any perspetive,
and I am going to include important points following.

#+begin_quote
it is worth emphasizing the distinctions between chunks and chunkmodes. Chunks are fragments of text and there might be multiple chunks of the same type in the buffer. In contrast, there is only one chunkmode of some specific type and multiple chunks of this type "share" this chunkmode
#+end_quote

and also

#+begin_quote
things like =poly-XXX-mode-map= and =poly-XXX-mode-hook= work just as expected
#+end_quote

Perhaps a path do understanding the nature of the mode is in "Defining New
Polymodes"

#+begin_quote
In order to define a new polymode =poly-cool-mode= you first have to define or clone a chunkmode object to represent the hostmode, and one or more chunkmodes to represent innermodes. Then define the polymode object =pm-poly/cool= pointing to previously defined host and inner chunkmodes.
#+end_quote

The example given is of a latex and noweb system:
- Define a host mode of a =pm-bchunkmode= for =latex= which is capable of containing embedded languages
- Define a =pm-hbtchunkmode= for =noweb= inner language
  - Defines regexen for identifying a block of this type ala noweb syntax
- Define a =pm-polymode-one= using bo them

Another example is given showing how you can re-use a host mode. Say you wanted
a mode for noweb that could contain chunks of ℝ instead of latex. You can clone
the noweb inner-mode definition and then define a new plymode. The vagueness
here is intentional because I didn't try it myself. Although I didn't dig deep
at all into the details, it is clearly a rich and powerful library. At the very
least, it is nice documentation to be read. The next ste is to set it up.

The functionality that I'm primarily interested in seems to be here [fn:aee1cbde: https://github.com/vitoshka/polymode/blob/master/modes/poly-R.el].
Skimming it a few things jump out:
- There is a base language definition
- Therer are *many* host modes for seemingly every markup out there
  - Noweb, Markdown, Rapport, Yaml, HTML, Knitr, Brew, RC++, C++R, R-Help,
    Rd, R shell, ESS combinations

It is not obvious to me how to set it up. This [fn:3dc322e2: http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/03/emacs-ess-and-r-for-zombies.html]
seems to indicate that one should do as I have done, read the home page, and
then go online for tips. Now, I have. This [fn:d1979851: http://johnstantongeddes.org/open%20science/2014/03/26/Rmd-polymode.html] post
was very helpful. A little unsure where to go from here, this https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2014-May/009926.html post indicates
that there are, just as the code said, 4 weaves that may be important:
- knitR
- knitR-ESS
- Sweave
- Sweave-ESS

Opened up a .Rmd document. Called =polymode-weave= and chose =knitR-ESS=. It
generated the corrent =.md= file.

Opened up a ℝ help buffer and the Examples section was formatted correctly.

Later I saw that I should have also read:
- [fn:ea37e53b: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/6994]
  - Release post
  - Good discussion, provides both context and ideas
- [fn:3133d97b: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8155]
  - Read this back then and it only makes sense now after reading the documentation
  - Very thoughtful and flexible and good
  - Other potentially interesting discussions

Load and specify file auto modes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'poly-R)
(require 'poly-markdown)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.Rmd" . poly-markdown+r-mode))
#+end_src

Specify some keymaps that are nearly what I have for =org= for the same tasks:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** Presentations

Before now I would create presentation in either
- Powerpoint [fn:9c6cd5fb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms_powerpoint]
- Beamer [fn:530d6432: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)]
- Slideshow [fn:c110948a: http://pkgs.racket-lang.org/#(!main-distribution)(!main-tests)(slideshow)]

I will still continue to use them as they are fine tools. =org= seems to have
nice tools for presentations, too, and I would like to explore them in the
future.

Eric added =epresent= [fn:f5183c88: https://github.com/eschulte/epresent], too.

***** Ruby [fn:e9aab149: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/]

My first setup of Ruby is primarily for Vagrant, so I didn't dig super deep into
the options. The defaults will be just fine. The stuff that I commonly use may
eventually want to end up in =prog-mode=, but I'm still not sure what really
uses that and how I may being re-factoring.

***** Standard ML (SML) [fn:eb5c01ac: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML]

=sml-mode= has its documentation here [fn:e31e1b22: http://www.smlnj.org/doc/Emacs/sml-mode.html] and package here [fn:185e62bd: http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/sml-mode.html].

I am not shy about including stuff that defaults fine in the mode when its
purpose is to educate the reader who /doesn't/ bother to read the mode
definition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'sml-mode)
(defun gcr/sml-mode-hook ()

=pretty-mode= will give us Unicode symbols for arrows and stuff, so this mode
doesn't need to handle it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq sml-font-lock-symbols nil)
#+end_src

When SML starts up, it loads =sml-config-file= by default. Perhaps some day I
would have such a prelude.

=sml-max-name-components= is kind of interesting… I will assume that it is fine
for now because until I know better, it is.

Like all programming modes… save everything before evaluating code.

***** Structured Query Language (SQL) [fn:a018350e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL]

Sometimes it is really nice to have SQL keywords written all upper-case.
Seriously. Although it is kind of a learning-phase where you must do that, you
really grow out of it at some point. Despite that, sometimes it is nice to have.
=slqup-mode= [fn:be68b5d2: https://github.com/Trevoke/sqlup-mode.el] does just
this for you. I love the package definition:
#+begin_quote
Its sole purpose is to make your life easier when writing SQL.
#+end_quote

What a great goal!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'sqlup-mode)
#+end_src

There is a =sql-mode= [fn:e151d946: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SqlMode]
of course, and surely I will need to set it up one day.

***** Table

Tables don't sound that exciting, but try running the world without a tabular
data representation! Not so easy huh?

SAKURAI Masashi has made it easy for us in Emacs with =ctable=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ctable)

***** Tag

Blogs use tags to add metadata to posts. The idea is not unique, but it is used
specifically in blogs. This document specified information to help to post to
a blog, but it doesn't work right now. Even if it did, I would still want some
way to manage tag data. Right now, all I know is that I've got the need and I'm
tired of doing it manually. The work done here is a first-attempt to manage all
of my tags, and I look forward to the ideal solution, and also the process, and
so it begins.

The Milwaukee Data Science meetup uses the following tags that were quite
specifically chosen given the goals of the group and limitations in the tags and
number of them that we may use. I will probably use the same tags for blog posts,
too, as some focus must be maintained.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq

***** TeX [fn:5bb50e18: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX] / LaTeX [fn:a13f106f: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX]]] / ConTeXt [fn:8a78f8ab: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt]

AUCT_{E}X is the mode that makes it possible to work with all of these fine tools.
Visiting their website I took their advice of reading the Info document in Emacs
by first installing it via Homebrew. That was my mistake since the prerequisites
page starts by explaining that this mode is 100% Elisp and that you should use
ELPA to install it. I started over again with the setup. When you read the
documentation, the first page explains how to load the mode and associate files
with modes but you should ignore that because when you configure it via ELPA,
everything "just works". Installation mostly involved the prerequisites.

This version of Emacs is modern. For TeX, on Linux, I've always used TeX Live [fn:841d4205: https://www.tug.org/texlive/] and on OSX I've always used
MacTeX [fn:490cc248: https://www.tug.org/mactex/]. Ghostscript comes with
both either via =apt-get= or =homebrew=. =texinfo= didn't seem necessary so I
did not pursue installing it.

Enable most of the stuff we need, given that I don't yet know what we need but
the manual helps us here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-auto-save t)
(setq TeX-parse-self t)
#+end_src

The "Quick Start" lists the most frequent operations, and I think that I will
get the PDF for them. Looking at just this tiny, tiny bit of effort to get
AUCTeX working… it is just so inspiring to see the plethora of amazingly
wonderful tools out there /free/ for all to use.

For a start, I will just do some basic stuff that I do for most modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/TeX-mode-hook ()
  "Settings applicable to every AUCTeX supported mode."
  (interactive)
  (turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode)
  (turn-on-real-auto-save)
  (gcr/disable-tabs)
  (fci-mode))

(add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook 'gcr/TeX-mode-hook)
#+end_src

Enable parse on load.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-parse-self t) ;
#+end_src

Enable parse on save.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-auto-save t) ;
#+end_src

Never save tabs because AUCTeX has a hard time with them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-auto-untabify t)
#+end_src

Before letting this mode process any file, save all buffers:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice TeX-command-master (before before-TeX-command-master activate)
  (gcr/save-all-file-buffers))
#+end_src

My typical preference is to easily work with XDVI during development and PDF for
deployment. My want had been to turn PDF generation on, while at the same time
still producing a DVI file. To do that, I did something like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-PDF-mode +1)
(setq TeX-DVI-via-PDFTeX +1)
#+end_src

***** Text

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/text-mode-hook ()
  (rainbow-mode)
  (turn-on-real-auto-save)
  (fci-mode)
  (visual-line-mode)
  (gcr/untabify-buffer-hook))

(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'gcr/text-mode-hook)
#+end_src

***** Vagrant [fn:a83cf3b8: http://www.vagrantup.com/]

Vagrant is quite nice. Perhaps a bit preemptively, I'm trying to get Emacs setup
nice for what I already know I must do.

This belongs in this heading I believe:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Vagrantfile$" . ruby-mode))
#+end_src

Nice package [fn:ccaa2275: https://github.com/ottbot/vagrant.el] for working with Vagrant; hundreds of people already using
it. No configuration even necessary.

This package [fn:4b850838: https://github.com/dougm/vagrant-tramp] is also quite nice:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'tramp
  '(vagrant-tramp-enable))
#+end_src

***** Version control / Git [fn:17977be8: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html] [fn:b573f4e5: https://github.com/magit/magit]

All version control systems basically work
fine in Emacs version control (VC) abstraction layer, and I like it a lot.

What made me focus on Git and how I work with it though was two things:
1-I use that for hours and hours at work and home and 2-I had been using
a standalone Git UI and I felt like it was kind of stupid not to use
something built into Emacs. This will require further research.

One thing that I did find that I wanted though was that despite having set auto
save to occur quite frequently, it was still possible to initiate a VC action
without the buffering being saved. My solution for that is that before *every*
VC action, at least the current buffer must be saved. This is OK because I
believe that VC actions only occur on a per-file basis, versus command line VC
operations. Then I added he same thing for diff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice vc-next-action (before save-before-vc first activate)
  "Save all buffers before any VC next-action function calls."
  (gcr/save-all-file-buffers))

(defadvice vc-diff (before save-before-vc-diff first activate)
  "Save all buffers before vc-diff calls."
  (gcr/save-all-file-buffers))

(defadvice vc-revert (before save-before-vc-revert first activate)
  "Save all buffers before vc-revert calls."
  (gcr/save-all-file-buffers))
#+end_src

Something that I never missed from Idea was version control status info in the
fringe, just never used it. Then when I saw it [fn:27efe175: https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl] in Emacs, I got curious about how
it /may/ be used. So, I installed it. Curious to see how it will facilitate
communicating the status of this document. Initial experiences has me thinking
that it is actually much nicer than I figured, so I will enable it globally
for a while.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-diff-hl-mode)
#+end_src

The log edit buffer is only used in VC mode I think, and needs to some
configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/log-edit-mode-hook ()
  "Personal mode bindings for log-edit-mode."
  (gcr/untabify-buffer-hook)
  (gcr/disable-tabs)
  (fci-mode))

(add-hook 'log-edit-mode-hook 'gcr/log-edit-mode-hook)

(defun gcr/log-edit-mode-hook-local-bindings ()
  "Helpful bindings for log edit buffers."
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-;") 'log-edit-done))

(add-hook 'log-edit-mode-hook 'gcr/log-edit-mode-hook-local-bindings)
#+end_src

=magit= also should have a similar configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/git-commit-mode-hook ()
  "Personal customizations."
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-;") 'git-commit-commit))

(add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'gcr/git-commit-mode-hook)
#+end_src

This current configuration that kind of maximizes speed, doesn't account for
multiple changes that need to be committed. Learning more about =magit= by using
it I thought that I should change the current =vc= workflow over to use =magit=
for committing. Comparing =vc= and =magit=, I decided that the current approach
is still fine because it works so quickly, because I mostly change single files
at a time, and when I don't, =magit= is so fast and intuitive, that there is no
need to port over my mappings or something into =magit=. At least, that is my
current plan for now. Magit is a really, really nice tool. It is pretty clear to
me though that my assessment of it says more about my ability to use Emacs than
it says about =magit=. Only after skinning my knuckles on Emacs, in a more
painful way, am I finally able to appreciate stuff like this.asdf

Git ignore files are just text files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".gitignore$" . text-mode))
#+end_src

=vc-annotate= is a fine way to see history. =git-timemachine= is another if
you are used to typical git UIs. It is especially kind of nice if you had wanted
a rich GUI diff. Instead, this just shows the entirety of the file at that
point, and sometimes that is just perfect.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** Web [fn:857fba7f: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML]

JSON support is included here, too. As you go about your business you read about
features that seem nice or you really didn't actively think about. One such
opportunity/mistake I am guilty of is using various web-based tools to
accomplish thing for example formatting a JSON string, like this
={"foo":10, "bar":20, "baz":50}= example. For whatever
reason, that is always just the way that I had done it. Reading irreal a nice
option/reminder was posted for a JSON formatter [fn:9d35fd56: https://github.com/gongo/json-reformat]

**** Module

***** Diagramming, UML creation, Workflow
        :PROPERTIES:
        :noweb-ref: diagramming-section-ignored
        :END:

How you perform these tasks is entirely up to you. There are a lot of good
options both inside and outside of Emacs. For the general cases, I like the
ones that are built in and play nice, especially with org-mode. At its simplest,
artist-mode [fn:5f9306fa: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode] is plenty fine for diagramming and stuff. Graphviz also works well [fn:93e16211: http://www.graphviz.org/].
Ditaa is sort of the next level up [fn:b6f5f0cc: http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/], and finally PlantUML [fn:245: http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/]. They are all good
options at different times, and they all work with org-mode. Everything I will
publish will go through org-mode. org-modes just shines so, so brightly.

As of writing, I'm undecided NOW how best to
standardizing on a solution in this area. The good thing is that each tool is a
good fit depending upon what you want to accomplish:
- artist-mode: Anything in ultra portable text, ASCII or UTF-8, just works.
- Graphviz: Graphically and lays things out automatically.
- Ditaa: Graphical but based on ASCII diagrams.
- PlantUML: Includes full breadth of UML options, everything: sequence,
  use case, class, activity, component, state, and object.
  - [[https://github.com/tj64/puml][This]] may help

ditaa was my first pick for usage for the blaring simplicity and power of it.
org-mode provides a setup [fn:69c0caad: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-ditaa.html]document that I followed. It required installing
a JRE and that was about it. artist-mode is automatically loaded for the source
block. The example below; thank you [fn:c8388777: http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Books_by_Craig_Larman] Craig Larman

In this mode I have no such solution, so I will probably forget while inside.

****** Discussion

Late into the development process I ran into some export to HTML issues.
After tracking down the source, I learned that tracking down the source of the
issue in the source itself was out of scope for me. My solution was to break out
the org-mode configuration into its own block so that I could generate two
Emacs configuration files. Doing so with a different section was easier, so
that is how I did it.

Tangling can take more than a few minutes; so there is some advice to report on
it just to me understand what is happening and that it is working. Another way
to perform this monitoring would have been to use around advice. What I ran
into is that on HTML export around works fine, but on tangling it did not. This is
something that I chose not to investigate; instead I reverted the tangling
advice to two separate commands and that seems to work fine.

Org mode, like most of Emacs more powerful modes, slowly grows on you, in
pleasant and intuitive ways. Pretty soon, you fall in love with it. After
using it for 50+ hours or so you start wanting some easier way to navigate then
by typing in the commands over and over (doesn't matter how you re-run them).
Reading the miscellaneous section, I learned about speed keys [fn:40a1962e: http://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-keys.html#Speed-keys] [fn:d064d3d8: http://notesyoujustmightwanttosave.blogspot.com/2011/12/org-speed-keys.html].
Wonderful, just wonderful.

Visualizing hierarchical lists in a flat manner has been fine for me. Sometimes
though I wanted to depth-based view, but didn't think much more of it. Reading
abouto org-mode, I came upon =org-indent-mode= [fn:20c464a3: http://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-view.html#Clean-view], and decided to give
it a try for a while because it is kind of easier to read. Both modes are
nice, and thus far I'm switching back and force as I feel like it. Once I
opened my eyes and learned about =org-hide-leading-stars= though, I really
found happiness.

One topic relating to color themes is that of how code should look within
a source block in an org file. There was a thread asking about how to
make the block coloring "better". It was interesting because it revealed my
preference to myself namely that source blocks should be a muted Gray in
the document because it shouldn't draw much attention, but in the editor of
course you get the highlighting that you want. That is really my personal
preference, nonetheless, =org-src-fontify-natively= is still always an option.
Over the past six months I think, this approach has worked out well. Nonetheless
I got curious about how things /might/ be with coloring turned on. Generally, it
looks fine. Strangely though, even with the =solarized= these it is kind of
distracting. Beyond sharing that observation, I won't quantify it any more than
that. The biggest thing for me is that I only want to edit source blocks in
their "real" mode because:
- The real mode is present and as such
- All mode specific bindings are present
- Worth mentioning twice because if I don't have helpers on then I will not
  match brackets manually!
  - I've broken code so many times making "quick fixes" and breaking the bracket
    matching it is exhausting
- Sending code to REPLs
- May not sound like much, but those three things are very, very huge in my
  work-flow

The good news is that for doing code reviews and stuff, I can always turn on
that fontification.

On a somewhat similar thread, =(setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)= would make it
easier to edit source blocks outside of the vehicle offered by =org-edit-src-code=.
Since my intent is never to edit blocks outside for their proper mode though, I
will not enable that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-edit-src-code nil)
#+end_src

This approach of mine, I think I touch upon it elsewehre… at some point I would
like to refactor this whole document.

This [fn:d58f4050: http://home.fnal.gov/~neilsen/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html] article is really fascinating in that crams a ton of information
into a tiny space. It also is kind of fun to read because it simultaneously
teaches you so many new things, yet at the same time re-teaches or re-educates
you about things that you already knew but didn't know that you could or should
be using in these additional manners.

=org2blog/wp= is a nice to have and its customization will be used exclusively
for Wisdom&Wonder.

The HTML export of org documents has an optional JavaScript supported display [fn:49c014be: http://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html].
Not sure how I ended up on this, but it is actually a very nice option. The
info style view is nice once you read the directions. The folding interface
is also interesting; I tried out all 3 generation options but didn't find
anything that I specifically liked. Perhaps it is a familiarity or comfort
level with GNU styled docs or the key-bindings.

Don't use =org= for time-tracking, but if I ever do then [fn:0276223e: https://github.com/koddo/org-clock-statusbar-app]
this is nice to know of.

****** Configuration

For this feature to work, it must come /before/ any =org= load statements
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-allow-alphabetical +1)
#+end_src

******* Org

=org= intelligently chose not to =autoload= everything. The most noticeable
things in the require statements for =org= are that:
- Only a few exporters come built in hence the need to require them
- =htmlize= is required for pretty HTML export of code

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
(require 'ox-beamer)
(require 'ox-md)
(require 'htmlize)
#+end_src

=htmlize= should eventually be moved out of this =org= block into its own re-usab.e
section. It does need confguring both for =org= and also for general use. I like
to be able to copy-and-paste its generated HTML into other documents, and =css= is
the easiest way to achieve it. At some future date, it would be nice to developer
a proper style sheet to handle any situation. The problem is that right now I don't
have enough situations to based a design upon, just the desire to do so.
My preference for styling HTML documents has been the same as all printable documents:
black and white. When you do a =htmlize= export in batch-mode, there is no bufer
style information to be exported, so you get nice black-and-white code formatting. This
is an acceptable approach, but I am getting close to setting up a style to product just
what I want for HTML export. It is close enough to almost require investment to address
it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq htmlize-output-type 'inline-css)
(setq org-html-htmlize-output-type htmlize-output-type)
#+end_src

=org-show= need special handling, see the install for details.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((pkg 'org-show))
  (if (not (el-get-package-is-installed pkg))
      (warn "You wanted %S to be installed, but it isnt. Fix this." pkg)
    (let ((fil (concat (el-get-package-directory pkg) "org-show.el")))
      (if (not (f-exists? fil))
          (warn "You wanted %S to exist, but it doesn't. Fix this." fil)
        (load fil)))))
#+end_src

Building =org= documents is intimately tied to:
- The =org= version
- The =init= version used to configure org
- Check the former
- Perhaps someday the latter should be checked?

There is an auto-complete provider for org-mode [fn:a94049d3: https://github.com/aki2o/org-ac]. Nice as I didn't even
think to check. Perhaps a check should go on the standard setup list. This seems
to work when you type out things like block definitions; and it won't apply
to EasyTemplate generated regions. =auto-complete= will still work on them,
though:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-ac)
(org-ac/config-default)
#+end_src

Footnote management is an important topic. Thanks to Richard [fn:44cb98d6: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-04/msg00172.html], there
is a concise approach for this, which I've pasted here:

#+begin_example
I use the inline footnote syntax [fn:: ...] for just this reason.  I
think easy migration of non-inline footnotes would be a nice feature to
add to Org, though doing it right would be non-trivial.

A strategy that another user once described to me for dealing with this
problem is the following:

1) Use a regexp search and replace to re-number the footnotes
   in the region of the text you want to move, giving them high numbers
   (e.g., prefixing each with "9999").
2) Use Org to re-sort the footnotes in the original file, so that the
   newly-renumbered footnotes all appear at the end.
3) Move the text and the footnotes to the new file, which should now be
   easy, since the footnotes are all grouped together.
4) In the new file, use Org to re-number the footnotes back to something
normal.

This sounded like a pretty good idea to me, though I haven't had a need
to try it myself.

Hope that helps!

Best,
Richard

This is an amazingly easy way to screw up your document. The more you edit

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

It is /almost always/ faster to work with org documents when they are fully

******* Babel

There is a hook for things to do after a source block has been executed. These
are my preferences for what should happen. This tip appeared in
this [fn:edec422c: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-07/msg00309.html]
discussion and Nick Dokos agreed here
that [fn:32dff2df: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/88741]
that it is the ideal approach because it does /not/ interfere with export.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gcr/org-babel-after-execute-hook ()
  "Personal settings for the `org-babel-after-execute-hook'."
  (interactive)
  (org-display-inline-images nil t))

There is a way to disable property inheritance that speeds up tangling a lot.
The problem is that you lose property inheritance which is unacceptable. Never,
never allow that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

You may display syntax highlighting for code in source blocks. I don't.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-fontify-natively nil)
#+end_src

On export, maintain the literal spacing as found in the source block. Obviously
this is important for makefiles. It is really important everywhere because
anything else would violate the law of least surprise.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation +1)
#+end_src

When edit mode is exited, the option exists to automatically remove empty
opening and closed lines for the source block. Never do this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

When source blocks are exported, do not indent them arbitrarily.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+end_src

For code blocks that I use a *lot*, add templates for source blocks because my
current approach is to do a =<s= \rarr =TAB= \rarr  =ema= \rarr =auto-complete= and you know
that is kind of wasting time. I will check out the statistics to see much I use
this to back up my claim at some point. Thanks John Kitchin for reminding me
not to be stupid [fn:028fcfca: http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/01/26/Language-specific-default-headers-for-code-blocks-in-org-mode/].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list
 'org-structure-template-alist
 '("el" "#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n?\n#+end_src" "<src lang=\"emacs-lisp\">\n?\n</src>"))
#+end_src

OOTB the templates are all upper case. Case shouldn't matter inside of =org=,
but on my system it breaks =org=. This needs to be investigated, and until then
I will just downcase all of the templates.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapc (lambda (asc)
        (let ((org-sce-dc (downcase (nth 1 asc))))
          (setf (nth 1 asc) org-sce-dc)))
      org-structure-template-alist)
#+end_src

It looks like ℝ is going to be another one, but don't process it to downcase it…
order matters here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list
 'org-structure-template-alist
 '("r" "#+begin_src R\n?\n#+end_src" "<src lang=\"R\"></src>"))

There is a performance issue with tangling when header property inheritance is
enabled. Eric explained that [fn:419e4704: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-06/msg00719.html] there may be performance gains if some
of the header properties are not considered. The list below defines what will
be allowed, and everything else will be removed.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let* ((allowed '(exports
                  file
                  noweb
                  noweb-ref

#+end_src

When source blocks are evaluated, their results get stored in a result area,
typically for display. If the results are small, they are displayed with colons
instead of an =example= block. My preference is to *always* place them in an
example block.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-min-lines-for-block-output 0)
#+end_src

I've got auto-save enabled for every buffet that has a file attached to it so I
rarely every think about saving a file. When you edit source code in =org-mode=
though and do it in a major-mode buffer for that code, =auto-complete= doesn't
apply because it isn't associated with a buffer. The following turns on auto-
save from this buffer back to the source =org= document. This value is
aggressively set to 1 because sometimes in haste you switch out of an =org= edit
buffer and then want to get back into it, and if you changes in it are not saved
they can be destroyed. You are asked if =Emacs= should, but it is not always
obvious why it shouldn't.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay 1)
#+end_src

The source editing buffer may be configured to appear in a few different places.
For a while I really liked =reorganize-frame= because sometimes you want to be
able to see the code you are editing in edition to the rest of the document. At
least that is what I am telling myself. Once I learned you could changed it I
realized that 1 I should have asked if it could be changed and 2 I should have
changed it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
#+end_src

When you evaluate code its results are inserted into a =RESULTS= block by
default. The documentation indicates though that you may instead use a name
if the source block has a name, or a cache-id. In either case, both seem to be
better options for traceibility.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

=org= has a really nice feature that hitting =C-c C-c= will generally just do
the /right thing/. It is really nice. That feature extends to source blocks of
course. Ironically I had a typo here, typing /of curse/ instead of /of course/.
The thing is that you really, really need to develop a personal workflow, and
then configure the tool to enable it. The more I learn about =org=, the more
leery I am about making it really easy to evaluate code. I want it to be a
really, really specific and decided action to evaluate a code block, so don't
make it so easy as =C-c C-c=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c +1)
#+end_src

=org= already uses the guillemet [fn:086b7602: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemets]
for demarcating noweb references, but it does it using the work-around of just
using less-than and greather-than characters twice. That is fine. Because Emacs
supports Unicode just fine though, tell =org= to use the real symbol.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

My preference is to rely upon heading property inheritance to define source block
names. That way, you can just do your work knowing "where" you are working and
keep it simple by not having to name everything. That was just fine until I
wrote a document where I needed to name each source block.

It gets easy to forget the source block’s name. Not the end of the world, but very nice to know.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

It would be nice to be able to use =vc-next-action= when editing source blocks in
the source block edit buffer. Those buffers are new buffers that get the
contents of the source block copied into them, the mode gets loaded, and
additional hooks for this special org mode source editing are run. When editing
is complete, the contents of that buffer are copied back into the source block,
the original contents are removed, and the new ones are inserted. I wasn't sure
how to proceed with this and asked the list. Aaron Ecay explained how to simply
close the buffer first. That is a nice approach because everything will be as
close to normal operational procedures as possible. Jonathan Leech-Pepin showed
how to get a handle on the source buffer, and execute some code in the context
of /that/ buffer. In this case it would mean executing the commit action inside of
the backing buffer. Both are great options, and I am having trouble with both of
them. The former is great because it is exactly how you would do it now. The
latter is great because you would *not* be interrupted with the source block
buffer being closed. At this point, I've only got the former working so that is
where I will start.

Not sure where to note this, but I do need to do it somewhere:

#+begin_quote
- babel, document my two modes of use as eval everything and store the results,
  replacing them, which is good for documents that use that data, and then the
  style I just did for homework which did ":results output silent" when the
  intent was more very close to coding, and ultimately using the code to deliver
  the consumable product
#+end_quote

******** Core Babel Configuration

********* Comments [fn:1e1a7e1f: http://orgmode.org/manual/comments.html#comments]

There is always a question of how to instill traceability in your artifacts. org
provides =:comments= for that. Tangling with that value set to =link=,
for example, would add a prefix and postfix comment to the tangled file with the
name of the header from which the generated file was tangled. When I tangle the
.emacs.el, then it puts something like this for that:
#+begin_quote
~;; [[file:~/git/bitbucket-grettke/home/TC3F.org::*Fully%20Loaded%20System][Fully\ Loaded\ System:1]]~

file contents go here

;; Fully\ Loaded\ System:1 ends here
#+end_quote
When you follow the link, it will take you right back to the block that
specified the tangling of the document. That is a start, though not super for
tracking down details of where the code snippets really originated down to the
source blocks themselves.

Trying to understand the other settings, I found =both= to look like this:
#+begin_quote
;; Fully Loaded System
;; Convert decisions into a runnable system.

~;; [[file:~/git/bitbucket-grettke/home/TC3F.org::*Fully%20Loaded%20System][Fully\ Loaded\ System:1]]~

file contents go here

;; Fully\ Loaded\ System:1 ends here
#+end_quote

=noweb= looks like, well I'm going to put a couple examples, because this
is the best setting. This provides was 99% of org mode literate programmers
want which is traceability back from every tangled piece of code to the original
document.
#+begin_quote
;; [[file:~/git/bitbucket-grettke/home/TC3F.org::*Windows%20%5Bfn:38%5D][nil]]
;; [[file:~/git/bitbucket-grettke/home/TC3F.org::*Windows%20%5Bfn:38%5D][nil]]
;; [[file:~/git/bitbucket-grettke/home/TC3F.org::*Frames%20%5Bfn:46%5D][nil]]
#+end_quote
After all of this research, I found that doing noweb-ref tangling, the source
locations are not included, so it is no very useful to include comments, and
I removed them, at least for now. I am not sure how I want to use them right
now.

The type of information that you provide as meta-data is up to you and depends
upon your mental model for your org document. My mental model is mostly to use
headings as the logical area for addressing a particular /concern/ satisfied by
that portion of my Emacs configuration, so the tangling comments reflect that.
In other words, in this document at least, I rarely name source blocks because
the header name is the "true name", and closing the tangle comment with the
source block name is really confusing because it usually is =nil=. The org
links are fine, too, because they convey all of the necessary information
whether you are using org or not. It is more likely that most readers will not
use org links, so they come second.

As it happens, that didn't really work out as I had hoped. The =link= style
works, and =noweb= does not. Not sure why and not digging further, so sticking
with that. Also, I had customized the links, and did that incorrectly, so I
removed those, too. When Eric said that one part of it wasn't implemented, I
didn't to dig into what was working anymore than I had already because it has
already been many hours invested.

Now I've got weeks invested and I'm shocked to find that using links in the
tangled file is worse then useless, it is actually harmful. It just doesn't
help, atleast in the sytems that I am tangling. As such I am no longer using
it.

#+end_src

********* Eval [fn:f6ab36a6: http://orgmode.org/manual/eval.html#eval]

This is probably the single most important configuration parameter for your
document's source blocks. Initially, that value is obscured by the need to
configure the rich variety of other options though, and this parameter is often
visited during the second eighty percent of your investment in =org-babel= when
you are "in the thick" of it.

Still trying to make sense of it all myself, I am adhering to a lightweight
user-story driven configuration of this feature, as I believe that it is the
only way that it will make sense to me. The key goal here for me is to:

- Define typical usage scenarios
- Identify key traits
- Realize those traits in my workflow

The current configuration is more like:
- Default allows for super fast code execution messages storing the results
- Any form of reproducibl research including for example a tiny, tiny bit of
  code necessary to get a =knitr= like setup =:header-args: :results output silent=

********** Story A: Messages

20% of my time spent composing email or mailing list messages. Those messages
may be composed of plain text with some nice markup. They also might have
references and citations. The big value comes with superb code block definition
and execution facilities. Those messages are short-lived; they are never stored
in =git= and unlikely to even end up on the file-system.

My work-flow here is:
- Compose the =org= document
- Prepare necessary buffers for code evaluation, or not, intentionally
- Execute (weave) source blocks and store the results within the document
- Export to the destination format

********** Story B: Notes

40% of my time is spent taking notes. It is so delightful to do so here. A lot
of those notes are for programming languages so the workflow is nearly identical
to =A=. The actions for navigating among source blocks is used all
of the time to quickly navigate the document's source code, reflecting more
thoughtfulness while working with the document. There is more concern here,
because the document is stored in =git= and long-lived, it will be published
many times. An important approach here is that I like to make a clear and
concise distinction of the responsibilities of tangling and exporting because I
don't like surprises. I want to know how source blocks results were generated,
and when, as well as details about the export itself. This is a scope
restriction that opens up space to make better sense of the workflow of the
document itself. At its simplest, I just want to see a date-time showing when
the document was published for example.

My workflow here is:
- Compose the =org= document
- Prepare necessary buffers for code evaluation, or not, intentionally
- Execute (weave) source blocks and store the results within the document
- Export to the destination format
  - Evaluate in-line source code relevant to that particular exportation

********** Story C: Documents

40% of my time is spent managing documents. In my case, it is this document.
There are others, but they are minute in comparison. This is the storehouse,
proving ground, and production deployment environment for every though, idea,
dream, and goal that I can come up with in regards to TC3F. It shares the same
traits as =A= and =B=, and adds many more.

The first addition is the utilization of =no-web= to tangle source code and also
tangle executable source code. The document evolution has relied heavily upon
this feature. It has allow amazing flexibility. It is so critical that it must
always be available.

The second addition is a different scope of concern. My desire to make the
tangling and exportation of this document is to have it more controlled. Unsure,
I waver between restricting evaluation of code blocks by default and enabling
over the entire document and simply allowing it globally. I don't like
accidentally evaluating source blocks and getting their results, but I suppose
that I may rely upon my commits to reveal my error. I suppose that my big
takeaway here is that I want it simple, and want to be able to lock things down
if necessary.

********** Study

Studying the scenarios, the desires seem clear. There is a combination of
agility and scope that ought to make productivity go up. The essence may be
better expressed in terms of responsibilities based upon my preferences
expressed above:

- A document is responsible for
  - Defining source blocks
  - Configuring their execution environments
  - Displaying their results
- Execution of this document is responsible for
  - Evaluating source blocks
  - Collecting results of evaluation
- Tangling is responsible for combining source blocks
  - In this file
    - For output blocks
    - For inclusion in source definitions used in function calls
  - In a new file
- Exporting is responsible for
  - Converting this document to a new presentation format
  - Only in-line source blocks may be evaluated during exploration
    - Be explicit about the difference eg
      - Execution results as stored in the document
      - Exportation results are stored in the export document
      - Key difference for people to make sense of things

********** Preface to Tooling

The next task is to convert the studies desired into a configuration to realize
them. At first blush the configuration options will seem confusing. The best
approach is to "play" with the configurations to learn and finalize your
approach. That is how I ended up with this configuration. All of the
configuration it based upon that combination of need and desire and how the
system itself works. At best, it will only make sense in this context. Over
time, it will make more sense. That period of evolution and growth is reflected
in the =org= documentation itself for example when you read about =ditaa= in regards
to exporting [fn:14fb5203: http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting-code-blocks.html].
The more familiar and comfortable with =org= one becomes, the more sense mentions
such as that make.

********** A More Concise Goal (Making Sense of Things)

This facilitate my personal model for =LP= with org for evaluation modes. There
are only two of them, =A= and =B=.

Mode =A= allow execution to occur where the results are likely to be captured
within the document. The single responsibility of that mode is to perform and
capture the entirety of the computation. That really sums it up. All computation
is done here because it is time and context sensitive. The document in that form
will serve as a snapshot in time. If you run ℝ code then capture the results and
plots and also the version of itself and the packages used. If you have
versioned links for your data set, then report it here. Think of future users
of your research as archeologists trying to piece together what you did; you
should make their job really easy. This is a self contained computational unit,
and its results, too. Include everything that matters for your computation.
Consider Vagrant [fn:28698f18: http://www.vagrantup.com/] regardless of how much
slower it may run on a virtual. How you defined this document and computed it
and captured the results are all *one* thing that needs to both be considered and
captured in its entirety.

Mode =B= is a little simpler. All of the hard work has been done. Everything just
mentioned has been done. This is purely responsible for publishing. Perhaps you
want to submit it to a journal, that is publishing. Perhaps you want to post it
on a blog, that is publishing. Publishing has different concerns. You want to
know about the environment used to perform the publishing, like the tools and
the time. Perhaps you want to more about the computer is was published on. All
of those aspects unique to that even of publishing should be included during
export. The operator really needs to get on-board with the idea of computational
artifacts vs reporting artifacts. For example if you execute mode =A= then you
need to store all of its generated artifacts. That includes data, but also
graphics that you reference in the document itself. Hopefully you are
questioning my claim here. You should! You area asking "Why should I when if I
can reproduce the results?!". Great question. The answer only makes sense
according to the philosophy I am embracing. Mode =A= defines both the computational
unit and its constituent output. That is a single /thing/, a single /thing document/.
Now that I am writing this, I am having questions about my claim here, and I will
explore them as my understanding is bettered. For now, I am sticking with this
because for example I know that I can use PNG anywhere. Well, questions arise
because I am unsure how I would publishing to the web without re-generating SVG
output vs PNG for web vs PS for LaTeX. Definitely something I will need to
explore and for now I am sticking with the plan. Just had lunch and reflected
upon the fact that there is clearly distinction between the results of your
computation and how you wish to present them, and when. My feeling is that my
approach is acceptable in that the computation and generation of summary
results is definitely a separate goal from providing it in a particular
publishing format and surely more experience needs to be accumulated here.
Perhaps the simplest thing to do for greater flexibility is to:
- In =A=
  - Perform the computation
  - Capture the results of the computation
  - Produces images and so forth
- In =B=
  - Convert to a new format
  - Perhaps utilize the results of computation to present differently

The key questions are:
- May you?
  - Yes you may
- Should you?
  - Perhaps
  - It seems easier to separate concerns into computation and presentation

That is why evaluation is available on export, to capture aspects unique of
export itself, and *not* of the computation. To realize this, the operator must be
very thoughtful and aware of the execution model of the document. As it stands,
you may separate the time of execution of code blocks and also their results.
This is a subtle yet hugely important idea. You may utilize this feature and
idea anyway you please, but I will use it a certain way. All computational
evaluation and results storage will occur for source blocks in =A=. That is the
goal. However, we do not want that to occur for in-line source blocks in mode =A=.
That is possible and doable. This will make it easy for the operator of the d
document to *see* the difference between code is for =A= versus =B= because the latter
will never have its results stored within the source document.

A strict separation between the =A= and =B=, roughly computation and export, must be maintained. It is the only way to make sense of how to use =org= as a tool here.
One mode is responsible for computation, and the other is responsible for
reporting. All of the following configuration is performed in order to realize
this goal of A:computation vs B:publishing (exporting).

********** Putting the Pieces Together

Make it crystal clear that if the operator wants to evaluate source blocks then
she may do so. It is a fundamental right of every =org= mode user and the default
configuration shall allow it. If she wants restrictions, then they may easily be
added to the document itself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
(gcr/set-org-babel-default-header-args :eval "always")
#+end_src

Separate evaluation into two distinct phases or modes that of =A= for computation
and =B= for presentation/publishing/exportation (still unsure of the best name
given the existing terms both inside and outside of =org=).

During exportation, only evaluate inline source blocks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-babel-evaluate 'inline-only)
#+end_src

During exportation, evaluate the blocks and replace the source blocks with the
resulting value. This gives you exactly what you would expect; the documents
look like plain old documents because they are exactly that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gcr/set-org-babel-default-inline-header-args :eval "always")
(gcr/set-org-babel-default-inline-header-args :results "value replace")
#+end_src

********* ℝ Specific

Always use the current ℝ session for evaluation.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gcr/set-org-babel-default-header-args:R :session "*R*")
#+end_src

Then I read this [fn:16e26884: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/32814].
*WOW*. That is worth another millions bucks for Eric's prolific contribution to
humanity with org-babel.

******* ispell

Doing literate programming a *lot*… it is a hassle to spell-check source blocks,
so don't. Actually, there are lots of things that I probably don't want to check
and this list is growing. All of the entries are explained here.

Never ispell org source blocks:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^#\\+begin_src ". "#\\+end_src$"))
#+end_src

Never ispell org source blocks defined in upper case:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^#\\+BEGIN_SRC ". "#\\+END_SRC$"))
#+end_src

Never ispell org example blocks:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^#\\+begin_example ". "#\\+end_example$"))
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^#\\+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ". "#\\+END_EXAMPLE$"))
#+end_src

Properties block in org do not need to be ispelled
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("\:PROPERTIES\:$" . "\:END\:$"))
#+end_src

Footnotes in org should not be ispelled:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("\\[fn:.+:" . "\\]"))
#+end_src

Footnoes in org that have http links that are line breaked should not be
ispelled:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^http" . "\\]"))
#+end_src

Verbatim regions in org mode should not be ispelled:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("=.*" . ".*="))
#+end_src

In org I often use bold text in lists, and they should never be ispelled because
they are usually abbreviations or other non-words:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("- \\*.+" . ".*\\*: "))
#+end_src

Most of the default org export properties should be ignored because they are not
words and I may ispell them manually when desired:

I am curious about using this mode to manage my email contacts and
=org-contacts= [fn:7964376b: https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts] looks like a
fine way to do that. Right now all of my contacts live inside of Gmail, and I
do back them up.

*** Provisioning / Cask  [fn:0d825bc1: [[Cask][https://github.com/cask/cask]]] / egl-get [fn:9be5a727: https://github.com/dimitri/el-get]

In /the old days/ the way you managed software packages for Emacss was to manage
manually because there was no software distribution system available. In my
case, I just put everything inside of a Subversion project and moved on. That
actually worked fine, but it was prone to some of the unpleasant things that you
would expect from doing something like that. In my case I didn't like committing
compiled code and handling updates was always a hassle depending on how files
and the directory structure had changed. Fortunately that all changed with the
introduction of =package.el= [fn:d0b53ba0: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA]
and ELPA.

When I first cut my system over to ELPA I went with GNU ELPA [fn:8e3f020e: https://elpa.gnu.org/] and Marmalade [fn:6c0f250b: http://marmalade-repo.org/].
Eventually I found that they weren't the right thing for me since the former had
a very small collection and the latter had a variety that I wasn't looking for.
About that time, MELPA was starting to really gain momentum.

MELPA is pretty super. MELPA is really a community and a belief-system in
addition to being a package repository. They value structure and form, and make
sure that the package builds and does that for you. They are doing great things
to create, nurure, and guide the community to become beholden to a higher
standard for certain situations. Around that time, too I got fed up with
manually installing and checking whether I had the packages installed or not,
so I looked at Cask.

Cask [fn:3e6e5e8c: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html] is a
declarative approach for expressing dependencies. That sounds fancy but it
isn't. Cask just makes it really easy to obtain ELPA packages from different
repositories. One reason that I really like is that you see all of your packages
in a single place rather than sprinkled about all over your init file. Something
funny happened though, the more I learned about Emacs and the community, the
more I found the need to manage software not hosted in MELPA.

MELPA is perfect at what it does, and it is still evolving. Rather than try to
plan for everything, the decided to solve 80% of most problems for most people
and that is super. Now they are looking at how to handle versioned packages by
hosting a stable repository that uses Git tags, and that is super, too. What
about software that doesn't live in a package though? That was my question, and
newfound need.

You start finding code all over not in packages. EmacsWiki is the exception
given that MELPA support that, but nothing else. That is good because it got me
motived to learn about other people's approaches for package management. That is
where I learned about el-get.

el-get is so powerful, and flexible, and concise. What it lacks in community
movement, it makes up for in raw power. Reading the configuration, I do really
like it. When I find code that doesn't live in packages, and may never, then
I start setting up el-get to grab it for me. Another time that I used it was
for Neil Vandyke's version of SICP in Texinfo [fn:0507a3f0: http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/].

This package is was interesting to me because I wondered how both tools would
handle installation being that all there is to be installed is a texinfo file.
That doesn't sound too exciting, but I knew that the final file is compiled and
I was just curious how the package-ers handled it. Here is how they seem to have
done it:

- MELPA
  - [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/blob/master/recipes/sicp][Here]] is the recipe
  - It uses the contents of [[https://github.com/webframp/sicp-info][this]] project
  - Which uses the files from Neil's site
- el-get
  - [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/blob/master/recipes/sicp.rcp][Here]] is hte recipe
  - It uses [[http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/sicp.info.gz][this]] file directly from Neil's site
  - And gunzips it

Again, not shocking, but it is kind of a nice example to see two different ways
both of /providing/ the package and also, and this is important, /communicating/
how it was provided. The latter has that communication built-in, unlike the
former. You can't force things with technology, but you may make it easier.
el-get seems to make it easier, at least when you want to know such details.

Not sure what the future will hold for me and el-get, but it is really nice so
far.

looks like the prefect presentation tool for me. jkitchin is just… he is one a
sweet wavelength. This presentation tool makes it really, really easy to present
in a very /emacsy/ way. It is worth discussing a bit why I got this module in this
manner:

- =org-show= is distributed as an org file
- It requires tangling to produce a emacs-lisp file for utilization by emacs
- John explains how to do so in the file itself via =org-babel-load-file=
- This works fine on a vanilla, =org= setup
- I do not have a vanilla, =org= setup
  - I do not know the issue and I am not going to debug it for now
- The approach here than is to:
  - Obtain the file
  - Start =emacs= with the =raw= setup defined in this document, which is nothing
    but =org= … and from there, tangle =org-show=
  - It is manual and that is OK for now

** Layout

*** Detail

Two systems will be configured here:
- "Raw org" :: org and nothing else
  - This configuration is to start Emacs with org loaded and absolutely nothing
    else.
  - This is useful for investigating behaviors in an incremental fashion.
  - Run it like this:
    - =rm ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =cp raw-org.Cask ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =emacs --no-init-file --load .raw-org.emacs.el=
- "Org Only" :: bare minimum necessary to run org-mode
  - Just enough to provide a usable environment
  - Both interactively (console, GUI) and non-interactively (interpreter)
  - Includes org and *all* of its dependencies
  - Standard artifact management with Cask
  - Version safety checks
  - Makes bug tracking easier
  - Reduces likelihood that packages bork org
  - Run it like this:
    - =rm ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =cp Cask ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =emacs --no-init-file --load .org-mode.emacs.el=
- "Fully Loaded" :: includes the kitchen sink, too
  - In addition to the above
  - Every else used in "daily life"
  - Run it like this:
    - =rm ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =cp Cask ~/.emacs.d/Cask=
    - =emacs --no-init-file --load .emacs.el=

  "Edit the current region in a new, cloned, indirect buffer.

  This function is responsible for helping the operator to easily
  manipulate a subset of a buffer's contents within a new buffer. The
  newly created clone buffer is created with `clone-indirect-buffer',
  so all of its behaviors apply. You may care specifically about the
  fact that the clone is really just a 'view' of the source buffer, so
  actions performed within the source buffer or its clone(s) are
  actually occurring only within the source buffer itself. When the
  dynamic extent of this function is entered, the operator is prompted
  for a function to call to make upon entering the new buffer. The intent
  is to specify the desired mode for the new buffer, for example by
  calling `scheme-mode', but any function may be called.

  The subset chosen for manipulation is narrowed by
  `narrow-to-region'. When the clone buffer is created, the lines in
  which the start and end of the boundary occur are included at the
  end the new clone buffer name to serve as a reminder for its
  'true source'. The intent is to facilitate going back from the clone
  buffer to the source buffer with knowledge of where it originated.

  BOUNDARY-START and BOUNDARY-END are provided by delegation of this
  function to `interactive'. FUN is provided interactively by the
  operator via the modeline in the same manner. See Info node
  `(elisp) Eval' for more on why `funcall' was used here instead of
  `eval' for calling the selected function.

This [fn:d95e8aea: http://endlessparentheses.com/permanent-auto-indentation.html]
post suggest that wanting to "never have unindented code again" is "aggressive".
Well, perhaps that is a bit strong? However, it is certainly interesting and
perhaps even controversial. Nobody wants to be locked down in their editor with
their code. Perhaps the bondage and discipline language user would disagree? I
don't mind, in regards to editors and code at least! Using this approach doesn't
prevent you from doing anything in particular other than poorly indenting code.
This will be a fun experiment and I will start out with emacs-lisp and ℝ to see
how it goes.

** Helper scripts

=keyfreq= is so focused and good, and it is built for one user. At some point
I would like to handle multiple accounts since I use multiple accounts on the
same machine, but until then, I will be fine just backing them up at least.

#+begin_src sh :tangle bin/cpkf :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
sudo cp /Users/sl/.emacs.keyfreq ../.emacs.sl.keyfreq
#+end_src

* Usage

** Develop

For some reason I keep forgetting about being strict about the workflow of this
document. I keep telling myself that little changes are no big deal. Well,
usually they aren't! Except when they are. Since I don't have CI set up on this,
it is up to me to play by the rules. Here are some decent rules:

- Identify change
- Make change in existing .emacs.el
- Test change
- Tangle using that change
- Test it again or not
- Tangle it again with the new file

Anything else will surely result in trouble.

** Deploy
#+begin_comment
This section will never be tangled.
#+end_comment

There are a couple of ways to use this system:
- Scavenge :: take the parts you need
- Develop :: grow it, grow with it, fork it
- Download and use :: the simplest case

The scavenge approach is built in because this is on GitHub.

The develop approach is pretty open ended. I develop in a private repository and
publish /stable/ versions here and that works for me.

The download approach is what I want to use on any system. I need to do some
work here. It should be really, really easy and fast to use it with any login
on any system. My goals here are to facilitate usage via:

- Download from GitHub
- Set up links
- Set up external library files
- Start Emacs

Right now I do this all by hand. That is not a lot of work but it should be
automated. At its simplest it looks like this:

#+begin_src sh
# Do something like this:
# export SRCDIR=/path/to/git/checkout
mkdir ~/eelib
export EELIB=/home/gcr/eelib
ln -s $SRCDIR/.emacs.el ~/.emacs.el
ln -s $SRCDIR/Cask ~/.emacs.d/Cask
ln -s $SRCDIR/ditaa0_9.jar $EELIB/ditaa0_9.jar
#+end_src

That is all it takes to run it.

My goal is to only publish changes every 30 days or so after I've had time to
use all of the features and correctly configure them. Keep in mind though, that
it is a /goal/ and not a /rule/.
