** Audience [fn:6873a93e: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=audience&ia=luna]

Who should be reading this?
Possibly…
- Entire document: Software engineers who want to do the above [fn:15b6c04f: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer]
  - If you are using this an excuse to learn Lisp, then know that it is really,
    really simple. Here is how it goes:
    - 3s to download Emacs
    - 3m to learn how to run code
    - 3h to learn the IDE
    - 3d to master the language
- Decisions & Assembly: Existing Emacs users… daily usage and non-trivial customization
  An interest in using package/el-get/cask and org-mode literate programming are the only thing that would motivate anyone to read this really.

This is an unfinished and experimental document. All successes with it
may be attributed to all of the folks who provided these wonderful tools. All
failures with it may be attributed to me.

Why should they be reading this?

** Cogito ergo sum [fn:bfef9921: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum]

What was I thinking?
- creation :: "the act of producing or causing to exist" [fn:77af012a: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/creation]
- conservation :: "prevention of injury, decay, waste, or loss" [fn:c6f84dda: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Conservation]
- computer files :: "a file maintained in computer-readable form" [fn:49968ef8: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/computer%20file]

Pursuing these goals, in the manner of literate programming, also serves to
better myself, as captured here:

** Means [fn:efbd05b2: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=tools&ia=luna]

How do most people do it?
- File maintainer :: a person and program responsible for TC3F
- COTS :: edit, VI, Emacs, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio [fn:95c9649d: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf]
- Bespoke :: custom software [fn:9bd5543e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_software]

What about their raison detre? [fn:47c1450f: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=raison%20detre&ia=luna]
- Wonderful, wonderful stock tooling, 80%
- Can tool-makers build it perfectly for us all? [fn:13: http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/509/lambda-the-ultimate-goto]
- Either way:

*** Goal

What is my measure of success?
#+BEGIN_CENTER
To provide a self-supportable environment in which the creation and conservation
of computer files may occur with ease
#+END_CENTER

** Decision

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor [fn:a9219a62: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/]
#+END_QUOTE

** Methodology [fn:8e6c1615: http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=method&ia=luna]

How will I customize it?

Agile [fn:99b4e7dd: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development]
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Review, Refine, and Reiterate
- COTS libraries
- Capture rationale and reasons along with things I did or didn't do and why
- Includes links to everything

Note: How you break up the initialization of a system like Emacs is mostly
personal preference. Although org-mode (Babel) lets you tell a story, I was
coming from a pretty structured configuration file to begin with. In the future, it
might be interesting to look at this system from scratch in terms of doing
literate programming. Fortunately, it provides that freedom out of the box.

** Observations

- Went stunningly well
- Stopped logging hours spent >200h
- This configuration was developed organically quite differently from the original idea
- Literate programming allowed an insanely flexible and freeing experience
- This one massive experience for me made a powerful, positive, life-changing
  impression on me
- My laziness and poor habits were made quite apparent going through the efforts
  to consider, realize, and support this system
- Before beginning I had no value system about testing this kind of artifact
- If this attribution, which is /only/ about Wolfram's MathWorld [fn:027a87a4: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/], the you may be interested in this style of programming and literature:
